He first appears in ''Cable'' #50, and was created by writer [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]] and artist [[Jos\u00e9 Ladr\u00f6nn]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nIn 1859, the immortal [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] during his time in [[London]]  decided that he would need a superpowered agent in the 20th century and imprisoned an unnamed human in a special coffin.  Inside the coffin, this man would be transformed by Apocalypse's [[Celestials|Celestial]] technology into the Harbinger of Apocalypse.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn the late 20th century, the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] found out about the existence of the Harbinger and intended to use it to track down Apocalypse for the Hellfire Club's exploitation.  [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] tried to stop the Hellfire Club, but he was too late and the Harbinger awoke.  The Harbinger defeated the Hellfire Club and disappeared, but Cable tracked him down.  The Harbinger told Cable that his programming dictated that he should bring destruction and chaos to the world, but he wanted to judge humanity himself before obeying.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\n\nSome time later, the Harbinger reappeared in [[Manhattan]] and decided that humanity should be destroyed.  Cable and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] battled the Harbinger, but he adapted to all of their attacks.  In the end, Apocalypse activated a bomb inside the Harbinger which would destroy New York.  Cable managed to prevent the destruction of New York by wearing [[Iron Man]]'s flight boots and grabbing the Harbinger.  The bomb exploded over the [[Atlantic Ocean]], killing the Harbinger, but Cable was saved by a group of time travellers.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Harbinger had the ability to adapt to any attack used against him.  During his fight with the Avengers and Cable, he showed superhuman strength and durability, the ability to fly, teleport and project destructive energy from his body.  The Harbinger also had a bomb inside him which was powerful enough to destroy him and a large city.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harbinger Of Apocalypse}}\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
