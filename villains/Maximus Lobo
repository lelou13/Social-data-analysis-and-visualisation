His first appearance was in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #417.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMaximus Lobo is part of a group of mutants that bears a striking resemblance to that of [[werewolves]]. He runs the company Lobo Technologies, which is a division of Worthington Enterprises and owned by the veteran X-Man [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]]. <ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #417</ref>\n\nIn White Plains, [[New York]], where Lobo Technologies is located, Maximus Lobo and more of his kind, the self-fashioned ''Dominant Species'', slaughtered a small group of humans, but spared the mutant girl who was present. When a team of [[X-Men]] went to investigate this murder, Lobo fought and defeated [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in a relatively short time. Lobo and the others then engaged the rest of the X-Men there and forced them to retreat.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #418</ref>\n\nLobo and his pack caught up to Archangel and [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], and tried to kill them off. There, he claimed to have killed Archangel's father. Lobo and his werewolves pursued the two mutants back to Lobo Technologies, where it was revealed that Lobo was planning to illegally sell [[Stark Enterprises]] products under the Lobo Technologies logo. When the rest of the X-Men arrived to help Archangel and Husk, Lobo created an explosion to cover his escape.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #419</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #420</ref>\n\nLobo and the Dominant Species later returned when the dimension-hopping [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] teamed up with the X-Men to battle an alternate reality version of [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]. Lobo sought to sway the young lupine mutant named [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Nicholas Gleason]] to his cause.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nMaximus lost his mutant powers during the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{Issue|date=September 2011}} Maximus was later confronted by a vengeful [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Nicholas Gleason]] after the events of the [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]].<ref>''Young X-Men'' #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMaximus Lobo is a lycanthrope able to assume a werewolf form with superhuman strength, speed, agility, stamina, reflexes, hyper-keen senses, and razor sharp claws and fangs. He also appeared to have some form of healing factor and extremely durable bones given his ability to survive attacks from Wolverine's adamantium claws. He bragged that his bones had evolved to be naturally stronger than adamantium.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2001]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chuck Austen]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains|Lobo]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants|Lobo]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters|Lobo]]\n[[Category:Fictional werewolves|Lobo]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength|Lobo]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds|Lobo]]"}]}}}}
