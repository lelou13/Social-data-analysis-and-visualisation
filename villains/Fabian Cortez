Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/illustrator [[Jim Lee]], he first appeared in \'\'[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]\'\' #1 (October 1991).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n\\n===Acolytes===\\nThought to be royalty from [[Spain]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, Fabian Cortez organizes the original [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], who pledge themselves to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his cause. Cortez then goads and manipulates Magneto into combat with humanity and the [[X-Men]] at every turn, leading to the destruction of Magneto\\u2019s space-station, [[Asteroid M]], and the deaths of the other Acolytes, including Cortez\\u2019s own sister [[Anne-Marie Cortez|Anne Marie]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' (vol. 2) #1</ref>\\n\\nCortez recruits a group of Acolytes who, believing Magneto to be dead and martyred for his cause, now worship him as their god, to follow Cortez in Magneto\\u2019s name.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men 300</ref> They launch several strikes on humanity, ranging from attacks on a military base where new [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] are being built, to slaughtering helpless humans in a hospital,.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' (vol 1) #92</ref> Magneto eventually resurfaces, sending his chosen heir [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] to inform the Acolytes of Cortez\\u2019s betrayal. The Acolytes welcome Exodus as their new leader, and Cortez is left behind.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #304</ref>\\n\\n===\'\'Bloodties\'\'===\\nFearing Magneto\\u2019s wrath, Cortez flees to [[Genosha]]. Still claiming to speak in Magneto\\u2019s name, he incites the nation\\u2019s mutant population into starting a civil war against the humans, the world\\u2019s first instance of the long-threatened genetic war between man and mutant. With the aid of the mutates, Cortez kidnaps Magneto\\u2019s granddaughter [[Luna (comics)|Luna]], intending to use her as a shield to protect himself from Magneto, the X-Men, and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Cortez is unaware that Magneto had recently been [[mindwipe]]d by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], and Exodus comes to Genosha in his place, seemingly killing Cortez.<ref>\'\'Avengers Vol. 1\'\' #369</ref>\\n\\n===Back with the Acolytes===\\nCortez reappears months later, claiming to have been badly injured, yet not actually killed, despite all appearances. He manipulates [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]] into posing as Magneto,<ref>\'\'Magneto\'\' #1 (1996)</ref> pitting him against Exodus in an attempt to regain control of the Acolytes. Despite his scheme\\u2019s failure, he is allowed to return to the team. Months later, at a time when Exodus had briefly been imprisoned, the Acolytes split into two groups, each searching for Magneto. Cortez leads one group, but they abandon him during a battle with the X-Men, upon realising how he has been using them for his own purposes.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}\\n\\n===Dark Seduction===\\nAlone again, Cortez is surprised to be recruited by Magneto himself, whom [[United Nations]] has given control of Genosha. Seeing as how Fabian Cortez had betrayed him earlier, Magneto only lets Fabian Cortez serve him on Genosha because his powers have been reduced and Cortez\\u2019s mutant power is to heighten the abilities of other mutants. After a further betrayal by Cortez, discovered by Magneto\'s UN advisor Alda Huxley to be the leader of the Genoshen cabinet assisting a rebellion in Carrion Cove, Magneto is restored to full power by one of the Genengineer\\u2019s machines and as he no longer needs Cortez, pulls him from a prison in Hammer Bay, Genosha fifty miles to Carrion Cove in less than 20 seconds. The impact kills Cortez instantly.<ref>\\"Magneto: Dark Seduction\\" #1-4 (2000)</ref>\\n\\n=== Necrosha ===\\nAfter the X-Men form [[Utopia]], Magneto joins them, saying he supports their efforts.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #516</ref> [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] especially wants Magneto captured for his collaboration with Emma Frost to overthrow her from her position as Black Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. She has three of her recently resurrected mind-controlled soldiers\\u2014Acolytes Cortez, [[Marco Delgado|Delgado]], and [[Seamus Mellencamp|Mellencamp]]\\u2014hunt down Magneto. They try to torture [[Loa (comics)|Loa]] to get the information out of her, but when she tries to hide in her room she finds [[Deadpool]] inside it. Deadpool battles the trio, but the techno-organic virus that is inside the Acolytes (which caused their resurrection) prevent him from killing them. At one point in the battle, Cortez grabs Loa by the throat and demands to know Magneto\'s location, saying that even though Selene wants Magneto alive he will fight the mind-control and kill him anyway. Loa begs Cortez not to make her hurt him, something Cortez does not believe possible. Deadpool knocks Loa out of Cortez\'s hands, but then is overpowered by the Acolytes. Loa uses her matter disruption powers to slide through Mellencamp, killing him. Deadpool, seeing that Loa\'s powers were able to slay Selene\'s minions, forces her to kill Cortez and Delgado too by throwing her into them (to survive, she has to slide through them, which causes them to crumble). Deadpool then tells [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] that he should not be in trouble because Loa had done all the killing.<ref>\'\'X-Force Annual\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nCortez possesses the ability to bolster another mutant\\u2019s power. He could enhance a mutant\\u2019s abilities to occasionally dangerous limits beyond their control (temporarily powering them up at the expense of burning out their bodies). In X-Men #1 (1991), while onboard Asteroid M, Magneto returned from a fight with the X-Men having suffered deep lacerations to his lower abdomen from Wolverine\'s claws. Cortez \\"healed\\" Magneto (as he said he had also done with his sister after an earlier battle) and temporarily brought him back to full health. This turned out to be \\"fake\\" healing in that Magneto needed to regularly be \\"healed\\" by Cortez to stay uninjured. Whether this was an offshoot of his main powers or that he was boosting their own natural healing abilities is not known. This ability was not used much or at all in his later history.\\n\\nHe is highly intelligent and an able military strategist. Cortez is also a skilled martial artist, and often carries a firearm.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===Marvel Zombies===\\nIn the \'\'[[Marvel Zombies]]\'\' reality, Magneto heads to earth to rescue anyone he can from the zombie plague. Fabian is entrusted with overseeing [[Asteroid M]] and preparing it for the last outpost of humanoid life.<ref>\\"Marvel Zombies: Dead Days\\" one-shot (July 2007)</ref> Cortez does this well; his group soon joins up with other survivors, including [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. Magneto perishes in battle against the zombies.<ref>\\"Marvel Zombies\\" #1-5 (2005)</ref> Decades later, in [[Marvel Zombies 2]], Fabian\'s child regains control of the colony during a battle with cosmically powered zombies.<ref>\\"Marvel Zombies 2\\" #1-5 (October 2007 \\u2013 February 2008)</ref>\\n\\n===X-Men: Forever===\\nIt is later revealed that shortly after the X-Men escape the destruction of Asteroid M, Nick Fury enlists the X-Men in helping him find and capture Fabian Cortez. The X-Men successfully capture Cortez, though he nearly defeats them single-handedly.<ref>\\"X-Men: Forever\\" #1 (2009)</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Television===\\n* Fabian Cortez first appears in the two-part \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]\'\' episode \\u201cSanctuary\\u201d voiced by [[Lawrence Bayne]]. As in the comics storyline, Cortez is the leader of the Acolytes and uses his powers to bolster Magneto\\u2019s own abilities. However, Cortez\\u2019s extreme anti-human sentiments lead him to betray Magneto and try to kill him, framing [[Professor X]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]; he captures and tortures the latter. Cortez threatenes to destroy Earth but is stopped by the X-Men and [[Amelia Voght]], who reveals Cortez\\u2019s betrayal to the other Acolytes and the entire mutant population of Asteroid M. He is trapped in Asteroid M by a vengeful Magneto, but is rescued from its destruction by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and [[Deathbird]]. Apocalypse grants him the ability of altering the mutations of other mutants.\\n* Cortez then appears in the final-season episode \\u201cThe Fifth Horseman,\\u201d now turned into a servant and worshipper of his savior. Cortez assembles a cult worshipping Apocalypse as well as the [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]], a foursome of altered mutants, in an attempt to find a new body for Apocalypse (who was defeated and left bodyless in \\u201cBeyond Good and Evil\\u201d). Cortez captures [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and turns Beast into a feral monster but is stopped by [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] (who was one of the Hounds). After being defeated, Cortez begs Apocalypse to be forgiven for his failure. However, Apocalypse is not angry, stating that Cortez has succeeded in providing him with a new vessel. When Cortez asks what he means, Apocalypse takes possession of Cortez\'s body.\\n\\n===Video games===\\n* Fabian Cortez is a boss in \'\'[[X-Men 2: Game Master\'s Legacy]]\'\'. Defeating him releases [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]].\\n* Cortez also appears in \'\'[[X-Men 2: Clone Wars]]\'\' for [[Sega Genesis]] as a boss during stage 3, before Magneto is recruited as a playable character. He flies around on a jetpack through the level, finally busting through the window at the end of the stage.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Cortez,_Fabian Fabian Cortez] at Marvel.com\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cortez, Fabian}}\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Fictional cult leaders]]\\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Jim Lee]]"}]}}}}'
