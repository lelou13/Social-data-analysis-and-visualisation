Vertigo can focus her power on one or more individuals, or project it outward from herself in all directions, affecting everyone within her range of influence.\\n\\nVertigo is not immune to her own powers, as she was thrown off balance when [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] reflected her psychic waves back at her with [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]].\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Vertigo also appeared in the [[X-Men Animated Series|\'\'X-Men\'\' animated series]] voiced by Megan Smith.
