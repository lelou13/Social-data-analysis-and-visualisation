Although he appears to be an adult male, his emotional and intellectual development is comparable to that of a child (it\'s likely that he has some kind of [[mental disability]]).\\n\\nOriginally, he was a member of the criminal [[Institute of Evil]], the Squadron\'s arch-foes, although, lacking sincere criminal intent, he was mostly following the lead of team leader [[Ape-X]], who had been his friend \\"for years and years.\\" After the Institute of Evil lost a battle against the Squadron,<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' #5</ref> all of the Institute\'s members underwent behavior modification, their criminal records were pardoned, and they all joined the Squadron.<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' #5</ref> Now, as a public crusader and adventurer, Shape helped supervise the manufacturing of force field belts.<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' #8</ref> He also helped his fellow superheroes and babysat for [[Arcanna|Arcanna Jones]]\' three children, becoming especially close with Drusilla Jones.<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' #9</ref> Eventually the behavior modification was reversed by the Squadron\'s opponents the [[America Redeemers|Redeemers]], but the Shape, having never been a criminal at heart in the first place, still chose to side with the Squadron against [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] and the Redeemers. After the battle, Shape helped get the pregnant Arcanna to the delivery room after she collapsed.<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' #12</ref>\\n\\nLater, Shape accompanied the Squadron in a futile struggle against the [[Nth Man]].<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme Graphic Novel\'\'</ref> As a result, Shape and the Squadron traveled to Earth.  There, Shape and [[Haywire (comics)|Haywire]] were mentally coerced by the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]] to prevent [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] from following the starship in which the Over-Mind had kidnapped the Squadron Supreme.<ref>\'\'Quasar\'\' #13</ref>\\n\\n===Powers and abilities===\\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}\\nThe Shape\'s entire body is extremely rubbery, putty-like and malleable. He has approximately 250 pounds of body mass that he can shift from one area of his body to another; when he is relaxed it settles in his legs and lower body. He can shift up to 80% of his physical mass at will, thus altering his entire shape. He can use this mass to elongate, compress, or enlarge various parts of his body, or form non-humanoid shapes such as hammer-shaped fists or a trampoline-shaped torso, or taking the shape of a hang-glider. His bones stretch to a maximum of five times their ordinary length. His body tissue can resist extreme temperatures and pressures, burning, lacerations, ballistic penetration, and impacts, without sustaining injury. The Shape has a high physical pain threshold, and superhuman durability. The Shape\'s below normal intelligence prevents him from thinking of more creative uses for his shifting body mass. He is not invulnerable: certain extreme physical injuries are beyond his ability to resist.\\n\\n==Supreme Power==\\nIn Part III: High Command, Shape is introduced as Raleigh Lund, a dim-witted, morbidly obese former janitor abandoned as a child by his parents.  He survived from a very early age by eating discarded food and sleeping in dumpsters. He possesses superhuman strength and apparent invulnerability. In \'\'Supreme Power: Hyperion\'\', he is described by General Alexander as the perfect soldier\\u2014loyal, invulnerable, and strong\\u2014though he is quite lacking in the area of independent thought and strategy.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*http://www.marvel.com/universe/Shape_%28Earth-712%29\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can stretch themselves]]\\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
