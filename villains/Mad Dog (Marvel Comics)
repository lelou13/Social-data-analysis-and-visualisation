After high school, he joined the [[United States Air Force|USAF]], serving in the Viet Nam conflict, eventually earning the rank of [[colonel]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #144</ref> He later became the security consultant to the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]]. He began an investigation of the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]\'s appearances at the Brand Corporation.<ref>\'\'Amazing Adventures\'\' vol. 2 #13</ref> While he was working for Brand, he and Patsy grew distant and got divorced.

Baxter confronted his ex-wife Patsy, and was forced by Hellcat to release the Avengers from Brand captivity.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #141-142, 149</ref>\\n\\nBaxter later allowed [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]], the company to which Brand was a subsidiary, to experiment on him and mutate him. As \'\'\'Mad-Dog\'\'\', he became a [[mercenary]], and directed [[Resistants|Mutant Force]]. He invaded the wedding of [[Daimon Hellstrom]] and Patsy Walker to abduct Patsy and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He was defeated by Daimon Hellstrom, and placed in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody along with Mutant Force. However, he escaped with Mutant Force.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #125-126</ref> He became an agent of the third [[Secret Empire]]. As security chief, he aided the Secret Empire and its leader, [[Professor Power]], in an attempt to start World War III. Together with Mutant Force, he battled and was defeated by the Defenders.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #129-130</ref>\\n\\nMuch later, Mad-Dog abducted and intended to kill Hellcat, but was defeated by her.<ref>\'\'Solo Avengers\'\' #9</ref> He joined [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] and other costumed criminals in an attack on [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].<ref>\'\'Avengers Spotlight\'\' #22-25</ref> He also unsuccessfully attacked the [[Fantastic Four]] during the \\"[[Acts of Vengeance]].\\"<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #335</ref>\\n\\nIn [[Toronto]], Baxter was caught up in the violent influence of the release of the Sk\'ar. He fought [[Gamma Flight]], but was teleported away by [[Manikin (comics)|Manikin]]\'s future self.<ref>\'\'Alpha Fight\'\' #111</ref> [[Roxxon]] hired him and [[Angar the Screamer|Angar]] to lead a group of operatives in a twofold mission: infiltrate and destroy [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. The villains stormed the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]], but the new Super-Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. eventually defeated Baxter and other villains.<ref>\'\'Nick Fury: Agent of SHIELD\'\' #32-35</ref> He fought [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], as the first of five competitors at a super-villain convention on Boca Caliente and was quickly defeated.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #411</ref>  He was later present when [[Captain America]], [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Shang-Chi]] battled numerous villains on the island.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #412-414</ref> He next worked with [[Taskmaster]], when was sent to test the skills of Siren, an [[Ultraverse]] resident on [[Earth-616]].<ref>\'\'Siren Infinity\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nMad-Dog gained superhuman powers as a result of bionic engineering and cellular augmentation by the Roxxon Mutagenic Department and by the third [[Secret Empire]]. Baxter was given superhuman strength and endurance, and superhumanly acute senses of hearing and smell. He possesses bionically strengthened jaw muscles, and has been given large hollow, fang-like canine teeth. His teeth can emit a foaming chemical poison, to which he himself is immune, which can induce paralysis and possibly death if it enters a victim\'s bloodstream through Mad-Dog\'s bite.  However, the process which gave Mad Dog his powers also gave him insanity which clouds his judgment and behavior.\\n\\nRobert Baxter has received combat training from the U.S. Air Force.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/maddogbaxter.htm|Mad-Dog}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1944]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from California]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Timely Comics characters]]"}]}}}}'
