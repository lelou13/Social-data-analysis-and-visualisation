He retreated to a mountain rising from the South Atlantic Ocean, there assisted by a large number of androids.  In a terrible accident, the matter transmitter permanently bonded Kiber's body with the molecular structure of his laboratory\u2019s floor.  Kiber was transformed into a misshapen semi-humanoid mass of protoplasm bonded to the floor, although he could project images of his former appearance.  He gained an overwhelming appetite to consume food, and discovered that he could gain energy by absorbing the consciousnesses and life forces of other human beings, feeling that this would lead him to immortality.  He ordered his androids to perfect the matter transmitter, and bring victims to him to absorb.\n\nKiber had captured the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s cousin Khanata,{{issue|date=March 2013}} so the Panther came to Kiber's island looking for his cousin.

He destroyed all the androids, and taking Khanata\u2019s life energy stored in an energy globe, the Panther left Kiber to perish with no energies to replenish himself.<ref>''Black Panther'' #13</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/kiberthecruel.htm|Kiber the Cruel}}\n\n{{Black Panther}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Wakandans]]"}]}}}}
