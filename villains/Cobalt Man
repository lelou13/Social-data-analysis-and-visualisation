He sought to use this as a weapon and built a cobalt suit of armor in imitation of [[Iron Man]]\'s, and called himself the \'\'\'Cobalt Man\'\'\'. At the time, Ralph\'s younger brother Ted Roberts was dating [[Jean Grey]]. Ralph Roberts took Ted, Jean, and [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]] on a tour of his lab, and when he showed Ted his armor he became destructive, and when Scott and Jean fought the Cobalt Man he buried them under rubble. As he was becoming more unstable, the [[X-Men]] fought and defeated him, and he realized that the armor was too dangerous to use.<ref>\'\'The X-Men\'\' #31</ref> However, [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]] soon kidnapped him to force him to build a giant super-cobalt robot. The X-Men fought Tyrannus and rescued Roberts and returned him to the surface world.<ref>\'\'The X-Men\'\' #34</ref>\\n\\nHe later achieved superhuman size and power due to radiation.

In an appearance which was widely previewed (first in \'\'New Avengers: [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]\'\' #1; May 2006) but which was originally produced as part of \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\' #1 (July, 2006), the [[New Warriors]] located Cobalt Man hiding in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] with other escaped convicts. The New Warriors were part of a reality show and decided to take down the villains. During the ensuing conflict, [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] used his powers to demolish the entire neighborhood, causing the death of hundreds of men, women and children, most of the New Warriors, and apparently Cobalt Man as well beginning the events of the \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\' storyline.<ref>\'\'Civil War\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\nRalph Roberts seemingly returned from the dead in the 2007-08 \'\'[[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]\'\' mini-series, but it is revealed that this is really a [[Skrull]] impostor.
