His first appearance was in ''X-Force vol. 1 #12''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nOne of the immortal mutants known as [[Externals]], Crule is the meanest and maddest of them all. According to [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]], during [[World War II]] he worked in a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]], happily operating a [[gas chamber]].<ref>''X-Force'' #12</ref> He is an ancient [[berserker]], dressing like a [[barbarian]] and old enough to remember [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithras]]. Crule was sent by Gideon to attack [[X-Force]] after they rescued [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]. However, Crule is blasted out of X-Force's ship by [[Rictor]] and falls a few thousand feet, which puts him in a body cast.<ref>''X-Force'' #15</ref>\n\nWhen The Externals kidnapped some of X-Force and were holding them for ransom, X-Force sneaks into Crule's hospital room and abducts him. He is actually happy to help the team \"humble\" his fellow immortals, and gives them the location of the Externals' hideout and their weaknesses.<ref>''X-Force'' #23</ref>\n\nCrule is apparently killed by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] in a final battle with the Externals.<ref>X-Force Vol.1 #54</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCrule has enhanced senses, strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance. His body has natural weapons, including hair coiled into whip-like braids, fangs, and gauntlet-covered claws.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality Crule, was named Wolverine after being altered by the Beast and serves Holocaust as his leading hunter. He was ordered by Holocaust to kill the X-Man closest to Magneto, in front of him. Crule displayed the ability to 'charge up' a group of bandits the X-Men were (easily) battling in order to study them. This effect enhanced their adrenaline production and nerve conduction; granting enhanced strength, speed and senses; but not to truly superhuman levels. The effect was dangerous; putting enormous strain on the cardiovascular system and muscles; at least one bandit died from a cardiac arrest as a result. It is not clear if this ability to 'power-up' others was shared by Crule in the Earth-616 reality, or was a result of genetic tampering. 'Wolverine' demonstrated far more tactical sense and patience than Crule, and had sufficient cunning, strength, speed and resilience to track and defeat the X-Men effectively single-handed. He was preparing to kill Rogue, as the person most precious to Magneto, when Gambit returned to the fray, hitting him in the chest. Wolverine laughed off Gambit's attack, not noticing a large charged up rock placed in his belt. The resulting explosion apparently killed Wolverine; although as an External it is unlikely that this was truly the case.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Crule Crule] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Crule_%28Earth-616%29 Crule] at Marvel Wiki\n** [http://marvel.wikia.com/Wolverine_%28Holocaust%29_%28Earth-295%29 Wolverine of Earth-295] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/crule/4005-15529/ Crule] at Comic Vine\n\n{{X-Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crule (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Nazis in comic book fiction]]"}]}}}}
