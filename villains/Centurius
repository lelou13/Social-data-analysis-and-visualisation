He attends a conference on genetics in the 1930s along with other noted geneticists in the Marvel Universe such as [[High Evolutionary|Herbert Wyndham]], [[Arnim Zola]], and [[Enclave (comics)|Wladyslav Shinsky]].<ref>\'\'X-Factor Annual\'\' #3 (1988)</ref>\\n\\nSometime after winning the Prize, Black goes mad, takes the name \\"Centurius\\", and seeing himself as the self-proclaimed savior of Earth, retreats to remote Valhalla Island to conduct genetic experiments. On the island he is successful in evolving numerous monstrous creatures.  During the transport of his newly created life forms to an orbiting space ark, secret agents [[Nick Fury]] and [[Jimmy Woo]] by chance discover Centurius\' island when they are forced to crash land their aircraft. The pair of agents initially attempt to convince Centurius to return to civilization with them, but when the geneticist\'s plot to destroy all life on Earth is revealed, Fury and his companion attack. In a ploy to defeat the agents, Centurius attempts to transform himself into a \\"superior being\\" using a device called the \\"Evolutionizer\\", but instead of evolving he \\"de-evolves\\" into a handful of protoplasmic slime.<ref>\'\'Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\'\' #2 (July 1968)</ref>\\n\\nLater, Centurius somehow \\"re-evolves\\" into human form and as a member of the group known as the [[Conspiracy (comics)|Conspiracy]], he clashes with the heroic monster hunter [[Ulysses Bloodstone]] when the Conspiracy tries to gain untold power by gathering and reuniting the lost fragments of the Bloodgem, a mystic jewel from another dimension.<ref>\'\'Rampaging Hulk\'\' Vol. 1, #3 (June 1977)</ref> However, The Conspiracy\'s efforts ultimately fail when their essences are absorbed by an enormous crystalline creature created from the Bloodgem. Ulysses Bloodstone succeeds in shattering the Bloodgem creature which apparently kills Centurius and the other members of the Conspiracy.<ref>\'\'Rampaging Hulk\'\' Vol. 1, #8 (Apr. 1978)</ref> Years later, [[Captain America]] discovers the skeletal remains of Centurius while exploring the Conspiracy\'s abandoned underground base.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' Vol. 1, #358 (Sept. 1989)</ref>\\n\\nMuch later, Centurius is found to not be dead after all and is a prisoner at the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]], a prison for super powered criminals. He is able to escape the prison with numerous other inmates.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' #1 (Jan. 2005)</ref> Centurius, along with many of the other escaped inmates, eventually becomes a member of The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]\'s crime syndicate.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' #35 (Dec. 2007)</ref> During an attack on the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] headquarters by the crime syndicate, Centurius is incapacitated by the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]] and taken into custody by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>\'\'New Avengers Annual\'\' #2 (2008)</ref>\\n\\nIn [[Secret Invasion]], he is among the many supervillains who rejoined the Hood\'s crime syndicate and attacked an invading [[Skrull]] force.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' #46</ref> He joins with the Hood\'s gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' #50</ref> He is later seen conferring with the Hood regarding the [[Marvel Zombies|zombie virus]]. Centurius advises the Hood not to pursue the virus, but the Hood is compelled by Dormammu to procure the virus anyway.<ref>\'\'Marvel Zombies 4\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nCenturius was later selected by [[Luke Cage]] to be a part of the \\"beta team\\" of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], alongside [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Troll (Marvel Comics)|Gunna]] and [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]].<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #156-157</ref>\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n*Noah Black is a normal human being, though an extraordinary genius with advanced knowledge of genetic engineering and other areas of science and technology. He holds a PhD in physics.\\n*Black was exposed to an \\"evolution ray\\" from his Evolutionizer device, which temporarily transformed him into a physically \\"superior being\\".\\n*Black apparently ages at an extremely slow rate because of his evolution ray.\\n*As Centurius he wears body armor of his own design but unknown composition which strongly resembles the armor worn by Herbert Edgar Wyndham the [[High Evolutionary]].\\n*He uses \\"stun-discs\\" and ray guns which fire unknown energies.\\n*Noah Black has also designed and built advanced aircraft and spacecraft, and a \\"thermalic suppression beam\\".\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/centuriusblacknoah.htm|Centurius}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1968]]\\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\\n[[Category:Fictional geneticists]]\\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
