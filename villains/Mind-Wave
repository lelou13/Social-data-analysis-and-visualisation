He robbed banks in Europe and America until stopped by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Uri Geller]]. At the time he utilized his 'think tank', capable of firing various weapons.<ref>[http://www.comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=7058 ''Daredevil'' #133]</ref>\n\nMind-Wave's mental abilities failed to warn him about the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], who killed him in the \"Bar With No Name\" massacre.<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = 1|issue = 319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\nMind-Wave was later among the eighteen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> Mirage disguises himself, Mind-Wave, [[Cheetah (Marvel Comics)|Cheetah]], and some of the other criminals as a team of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] trying to kill the Punisher. After the Punisher uncovers the ruse, he captures Mirage, kills Mind-Wave with a grenade and leaves him with a grenade as a booby trap for [[Letha]], [[Lascivious (comics)|Titania]] and [[Black Abbott (comics)|Black Abbot]] to find.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #8</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMind-Wave wore a helmet of his own design that boosted his natural mind powers particularly [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], with which he could blindside a non-telepathic opponent at will.  His helmet also enabled him to communicate mentally with others wearing similar helmets, with his \"Think Tank\" or with other ESPers.\n\nMind-Wave's \"Think Tank\" was a large, heavily armed vehicle control by his mental powers which he used to rob banks.  It had heat-ray cannons.  He also carried hand-held versions of the heat ray.\n\n==Second Mindwave==\nA new Mindwave appeared as a [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] violator.  He amused the officers of a Las Vegas, Nevada police precinct by claiming he was there to officially protest the Registration Act and stating that his codename was different from the man who was called \"Mind Hyphen Wave.\" He then used his telekinetic powers to destroy the station and kill the officers present before calmly surrendering to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #116</ref>\nMindwave was escorted to a cell in Thunderbolts Mountain.  When the guards walked away, he began a telepathic conversation with fellow prisoners Caprice, [[Blue Streak (comics)#Caged Angels|Bluestreak]] and [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)#Caged Angels|Mirage]].  He suggested that it would be fun to interfere with the surgery scheduled to be performed on [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117</ref> However, Bullseye recovered from his surgery while Mindwave was focusing on the other Thunderbolts, and killed Mindwave and his allies in their cells using thrown scalpels.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121</ref>\nThis version of Mindwave was primarily a very powerful telekinetic, with the ability to destroy structures and halt and redirect hails of bullets in mid-flight. He also had some measure of telepathic ability, which he used to converse with his fellow prisoners and combine his power with theirs, in an attempt to destroy Thunderbolts by driving them insane. He wore a costume composed of dark body armor and a helmet resembling a gas mask.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/mindwave.htm|Mind-Wave}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jim Mooney]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]"}]}}}}
