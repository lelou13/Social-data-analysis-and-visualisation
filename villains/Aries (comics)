All of them have been members of the villainous Zodiac and used horns on their head to ram their opponents. The third Aries was a [[Life Model Decoy]] created by [[Scorpio (comics)|Jake Fury]]. The second and fourth Aries' were [[African-American]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe original human Aries, Marcus Lassiter, first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #72 (January 1970), and was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]]. The character subsequently appears in ''Avengers'' #82 (November 1970), in which he is killed.\n\nThe second human Aries, Grover Raymond, first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #120-123 (February\u2013May 1974), and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]]. The character subsequently appears in ''Ghost Rider'' #7 (August 1974), and ''Captain America'' #177-178 (September\u2013October 1974), in which he is killed.\n\nAries appeared as part of the \"Zodiac\" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #20.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Marcus Lassiter===\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=\n|caption=\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\n|character_name=Aries\n|real_name=Marcus Lassiter\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #72 (January 1970)\n|alliances=[[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac Cartel]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=Wore a pair of ram's horns upon his head which he could use to ram opponents in battle. He briefly possessed the [[Zodiac Key]], which he was able to use to channel energy blasts, and powered his ship's force field, which he used to surround all of Manhattan.\n|}}\nNothing is known about how Lassiter joined the Cartel or any of his dealings with their group prior to their first battle with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n\nIn order to take down the Zodiac Cartel [[Nick Fury]], disguised as [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]] captured the Avengers. He called the Cartel for a meeting in order to present the Avengers to them. The Avengers managed to break free before the Cartel could execute them. Fury unmasked himself and joined the heroes in fighting off the Zodiac Cartel. Aries managed to claim the Zodiac Key, and led the Cartel to their escape through a hole in the wall.<ref>''Avengers'' #72</ref>\n\nLassiter led the reorganization of the Cartel and its planning to take over [[Manhattan]]. A mercenary group in the Zodiac's employ was sent to [[Avengers Mansion]] and was able to subdue the Avengers who were subsequently put into stasis. The Aries-led Zodiac army was able to take over Manhattan. Aries used the Zodiac Key to entrapping it within a force field. The Cartel demanded one billion dollars or they threatened to kill the entire population of Manhattan. The [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] managed to free the Avengers, and, in the ensuing battle, Aries was apparently slain. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] destroyed his vessel with a bolt of lightning. The rest of the Zodiac Cartel escaped capture.<ref>''Avengers'' #82</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===Grover Raymond===\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=\n|caption=\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\n|character_name=Aries\n|real_name='''(I)''' Marcus Lassiter<br />'''(II)''' Grover Raymond<br />'''(III)''' None<br />'''(IV)''' Unrevealed<br />'''(V)''' Unrevealed<br />'''(VI)''' ?\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #120 (February 1974)\n|creators=[[Steve Englehart]]<br />[[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]]\n|alliances=[[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac Cartel]]\n|aliases=[[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]]\n|powers=Wore a ram's horns upon his head, and would ram his opponents in battle.

While possessed by [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]], his body was charged with ionic energy, granting him superhuman strength.\n|}}\nGrover Raymond was recruited by [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]] to replace Marcus Lassiter as Aries. The Zodiac Cartel decided to kill every person born under the sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] because they thought them to be untrustworthy. The Cartel was defeated by the Avengers who were able to destroy the [[Star-Blaster]] which the Zodiac was to use to fulfill their plans.\n\nFollowing their defeat, Raymond was able to get the rest of the Cartel, except for [[Libra (comics)|Libra]] to back him in overthrowing Taurus as their leader. The renegade Zodiac met with Cornelius Van Lunt, the Cartel's financial backer, in an empty warehouse but were attacked by the Avengers during the meeting. Van Lunt fled, but revealed that he was Taurus and that the warehouse was, in fact, a rocketship which Taurus shot into space. The [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] was able to persuade the Zodiac to help the Avengers get back to earth rather than continue their battle. Upon their return to earth, the Avengers turned Aries and the other Zodiac, except for Libra, over to the authorities. Except for Taurus, all the Cartel ended up in prison.<ref>''Avengers'' #120-122</ref>\n\nWhile in prison, Raymond was visited by [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]], who had possessed the body of Rafe Michel, a criminal. In order to keep his power from consuming a single body, Lucifer offered to divide his power. Raymond agreed, and gained some of Lucifer's strength, along with his costume. They did battle with the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], but managed to escape to [[Mr. Morgan]]. Morgan asked the two to kill the Falcon.<ref>''Captain America'' #177</ref>\n\nThe two Lucifers attacked, but were defeated by the Falcon. Raymond-Lucifer led the other to Lucifer's base, where they revived Lucifer's undamaged Ultra-Robots and sent them to attack the Falcon. The Falcon, though, was helped by an uncostumed [[Captain America]], who defeated the Lucifers and destroyed the Ultra-Robots. Still unable to contain Lucifer's energies, both host bodies died with Lucifer being sent back to the [[Nameless Dimension]].<ref>''Captain America'' #178</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===LMD===\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=\n|caption=\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\n|character_name=Aries\n|real_name=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #49 (July 1977)\n|creators=[[David Anthony Kraft]]<br />[[Keith Giffen]]\n|alliances=[[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac Cartel]]<br />[[Jake Fury|Jake Fury's]] [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=Possessed a pair of horns on its head, enhanced strength, and would attempt to ram its opponents in battle.

The [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] attacked the Theatre and Scorpio was forced to activated the LMD Zodiac prematurely. The Aries LMD rushed into battle but was hampered by his clumsiness and recklessness. During the battle [[Moon Knight]] and [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] were able to cause Aries to slam into a wall knocking it unconscious. The Aries LMD was taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody following the battle.<ref>''Defenders'' #48-50</ref>\n\nLater, Aries and the rest of the LMD Zodiac, led by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], battled the Avengers whom Quicksilver was attempting to frame for treason. During an underwater battle near Avengers Mansion with a team of the heroes, the Aries and [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]] LMDs were flung out into the river and apprehended by the authorities.<ref>''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #1</ref>\n\nAfter being released from prison, Aries and the rest of the LMD Zodiac attacked and killed all the human Zodiac Cartel except for Cornelius Van Lunt (aka Taurus). Soon after the LMD Zodiac attempted to rob the Denver Mint, but were interrupted by the [[West Coast Avengers]]. During the battle the [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]] LMD brought both the Zodiac and the Avengers to the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|Ankh Dimension]], but this had the unwanted result of shutting down all the LMDs, leaving them immobile in that foreign dimension.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #26-28</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===Fourth Aries===\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=\n|caption=\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\n|character_name=Aries\n|real_name=Unrevealed\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Iron Man]]'' #184 (July 1984)\n|creators=[[Dennis O'Neil]]<br />[[Luke McDonnell]]\n|alliances=[[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac Cartel]]\n|aliases=\n|powers= Wore the horns of a ram on his head which he could use to ram opponents.\n|}}\nIt is unknown who the person was who became this version of Aries or how he joined the Zodiac Cartel.
