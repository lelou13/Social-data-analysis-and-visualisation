An ordinary pharmaceutical factory worker, he was exposed to psychoactive chemicals from a fire. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] rescued him from the fire, but he had already begun to mutate, causing Thor to go on a rampage just by his touch.<ref>''Nova'' #4</ref> Day was soon transferred to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' [[Avengers Mansion|mansion]] for treatment. He escaped, abandoning his wife, and became the head of the criminal Inner Circle. With the Inner Circle, he recruited people in financial straits, supplying financial assistance requiring the victims to commit crimes on his behalf. Corruptor later abandoned the Circle.<ref>''Nova'' #21</ref>\n\nHe formed a new plan that started out by corrupting the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], forcing the Hulk's best friend [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] to summon the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] so that the Corruptor could corrupt them as well. Rick's SOS instead was intercepted by several superheroes based in the Southwest, including [[Firebird (comics)|Firebird]], [[Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade)]], [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]], [[Texas Twister]], and [[Shooting Star (comics)|Shooting Star]]. The plan was foiled, as the Corrupter lost control of the Hulk who managed to capture the Corruptor.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #264-265</ref> The western heroes decided to stay together and become the group, the Rangers.\n\nSome time later he became a pawn of [[Imus Champion]] and somehow acquired mind control powers which he used to turn the [[Squadron Supreme]] against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] shortly after they returned from the Franklin Richards version of [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]].<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #6</ref>\n\nThe Corruptor managed to escape to Japan where he was soon confronted by [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] who detained him in The Vault and eventually [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft.]]<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #32</ref> He was one of the 46 villains to escape [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]] when [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] broke out [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #6</ref> He was becoming a thrall of the villain [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]]. During his efforts in service to Crossfire, Corruptor was again defeated by [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spider-Man: Breakout'' #1-5</ref>\n\nHe found his way back to his home town, Smyrna, Delaware, and began an elaborate plan to take over the city. Using flowers grown from water distilled with his own sweat, he managed to release his chemical influence over the entire town, quickly setting himself up as its mayor. His scheme was uncovered by the New Warriors, who were roaming the country helping small towns fight big villains, and the Corruptor was defeated once more.<ref>''The New Warriors'' vol. 2 #6</ref> He was later involved in a [[Advanced Idea Mechanics#Splinter groups|R.A.I.D]] terror plot in [[London]], only to be foiled by [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]].<ref>''Union Jack'' #1-3</ref>\n\nJackson has been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>''New Avengers'' #35</ref> He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Dr. Strange.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #2</ref> In [[Secret Invasion]], he is one among many of supervillains who rejoined of The Hood's crime syndicate and attacked a [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref> He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref>\n\n[[Living Laser]] and the Corruptor attack [[Bucky]] and [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] as they spy on some [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] agents from a rooftop in [[Brooklyn]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #61</ref> He was later seen during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] as part of the Hood crime syndicate.<ref>''Siege'' #3</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nThe Corruptor's sweat glands exude psychoactive drugs which enable him to, by touch, subvert the will of any individual. His touch releases his victim's inhibitions, so that, if not given specific instructions, the victim will revert to uncontrollable behavior. Early in his career, he demonstrated such powers as super-strength, eye-beams, and teleportation, none of which he possesses today.\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/c/corruptor.htm Corruptor at MarvelDirectory.com]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Delaware]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
