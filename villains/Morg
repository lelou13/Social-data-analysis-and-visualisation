He was created by [[Ron Lim]] and [[Ron Marz]] and first appeared in \'\'[[Silver Surfer]]\'\' vol. 3, #69(August 1992)\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n\\n===Origin===\\nMorg served as a herald of [[Galactus]] after Galactus\' previous herald, [[Frankie Raye|Nova]], was expelled for sparing suitable but inhabited planets from his hunger. Subsequently, prior to consuming his latest planet, Galactus was confronted by Morg; a court executioner who had betrayed his own race by executing his own people for those that had defeated them. In the presence of the world-devourer, Morg showed no fear; instead exhibiting a respectful defiance. Impressed with Morg\'s demeanor and wary after losing several heralds to attacks of conscience, Galactus decided to employ this most brutal and remorseless specimen as his latest herald.\\n\\nMorg gladly accepted the task of being Galactus\' herald. As a weapon, Morg wields a double-edged battle axe \\u2014 previously used by him in his executioner duties.<ref>\'\'Silver Surfer\'\' Vol. 3 #70</ref>\\n\\n===Becoming Galactus\' Herald===\\nOne of Galactus\' former heralds, the [[Silver Surfer]], went to meet Nova but instead found out that she had been dismissed and replaced by Morg. After informing the Surfer of this, Galactus told the Surfer to leave; however, the Surfer refused to leave without seeing Nova, resulting in a battle with Morg. After fighting Morg and noticing his heartlessness, the Surfer decided to go find Nova and the rest of Galactus\'s former heralds and have them join him in another battle against Morg.<ref>\'\'Silver Surfer\'\' Vol. 3 #70-71</ref>\\n\\nWhile seeking reinforcements, the heralds found by the Silver Surfer included [[Firelord]], [[Frankie Raye|Nova]], [[Terrax]] and [[Air-Walker]], whom they had to unearth from his grave and reassemble. During this time, Morg discovered a Well on a planet to which he had led Galactus, and in this well were waters containing \\"mystical power\\". Morg immersed himself in the pool, which enhanced his powers exponentially before he returned to his master and destroying the planet.<ref>\'\'Silver Surfer\'\' Vol. 3 #72-74</ref>\\n\\nThe assembled heralds confronted Morg together, and Terrax used the fact that they were not able to defeat him to convince the Surfer to instead try to get help from Galactus. While the Surfer was gone, Air-Walker was severely damaged again and Morg killed Nova by blasting her in the back when he was thought to have been beaten. Galactus was not pleased with this, so he removed the Power Cosmic that he had imbued in Morg, leaving him with only the power he\'d gained from the pool he\'d discovered. In his weakened state, Morg was killed by Terrax. After the battle both Firelord and Air Walker volunteered to work for Galactus in order to gain access to Galactus\' technology.<ref>\'\'Silver Surfer\'\' Vol. 3 #75</ref>\\n\\nMonths later, Galactus resurrected Morg to give him a second chance.<ref>\'\'Silver Surfer\'\' Vol. 3 #76-77</ref> Morg then sought his missing axe.<ref>\'\'Silver Surfer\'\' Vol. 3 #77-79</ref> Morg went off in search of Terrax to exact vengeance upon him, but in their battle they were ambushed by robots working for the villain [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]] and were taken captive.<ref>\'\'Silver Surfer\'\' Vol. 3 #80</ref>\\n\\nMorg, along with fellow captives Silver Surfer, Terrax, [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Beta Ray Bill]], [[Jack of Hearts]] and [[Ganymede (comics)|Ganymede]] fought back against Tyrant and were easily defeated until the appearance of Galactus disrupted the battle. Morg had been incapacitated in the battle, like all those involved, save for the Surfer. Tyrant stated that everyone there could go free, except for Morg, for no other reason than to spite the world devourer.<ref>\'\'Silver Surfer\'\' Vol. 3 #82</ref>\\n\\nTyrant imprisoned Morg and continued to siphon off his Power Cosmic and store it into his orbs. Eventually Morg escaped and went back to his master Galactus and served as herald again for a brief time. In a battle between Galactus and Tyrant,<ref>\'\'Silver Surfer\'\' vol. 3 #109</ref> Morg found the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] and used it to melt most of Tyrant\'s body then betrayed both masters by cutting off his own arm while he tried to escape the final nullification blast (Tyrant\'s drone attached itself to the Nullifier and Morg\'s arm thus not allowing Morg to separate himself from the Nullifier). His escape failed and the Nullifier exploded, destroying Galactus\' ship and all aboard.<ref>\'\'Silver Surfer\'\' vol 3 #109</ref>\\n\\n[[Annihilus]] later attempts to retrieve the Power Cosmic from Morg\'s corpse, but fails.<ref>\'\'[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]: Silver Surfer\'\'</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nMorg was imbued with the Power Cosmic by Galactus, as he did with all his heralds. The physical transformation by the cosmic power of Galactus allowed Morg to fly through space and granted him exponentially enhanced superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. Morg can manipulate cosmic energy for various effects, including the projection of energy bolts of cosmic force, the augmentation of his strength to even greater superhuman levels, and survive unprotected in the vacuum of outer space without the need of oxygen, food or sleep. Morg carried a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} double-bladed cosmic axe with a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} handle, able to emanate waves of destructive force sufficiently powerful to rend a tear in Galactus\'s ship and to create highly impervious force shields.  The mystical pool, the Well of Life, that Morg immersed himself in augmented each of these abilities further,<ref>Silver Surfer vol. 3 #2</ref> making him more powerful than any other single herald, even more so than the Silver Surfer. It is unknown whether this still holds true after the events of Annihilation Wave, when Silver Surfer was empowered further by Galactus.<ref>Annihilation: Silver Surfer #1-#4</ref>\\n\\nMorg was also an experienced fighter and executioner.\\n\\n==In other media==\\nMorg was to have appeared in the second season of \'\'[[The Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]\'\' animated series. His appearance was in the episode \\"Soul Hunter, Part 1\\". The Silver Surfer had to save The Universal Library from Morg and Thiran. Both are part of a race called the Sargs.\\n\\nA Morg [[Minimate]] will be featured in the [[Toys R Us]] exclusive \'\'Heralds of Galactus\'\' boxset.<ref>[http://www.artasylum.com/blog/2011/09/final-heralds-of-galactus-minimates-box-set-line-up-revealed/ Minimate announcement]</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvelwiki|Morg|Morg}}\\n*[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=51687 \'\'Grand Comics Database\'\'\'s entry on the issue of Silver Surfer containing Morg\'s debut]\\n\\n{{Silver Surfer}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992]]\\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
