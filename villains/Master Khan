He first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #77 (October 1960), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].\n\nWithin the shared universe of that company's publications, Master Khan is a sinister sorcerer \"god\" of [[K'un-L'un]] who demands human blood sacrifices from his worshippers.\n\n==Publication history==\nMaster Khan first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #77 (October 1960), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''Marvel Premiere'' #22 (June 1975), #24 (September 1975), ''Iron Fist'' #1-2 (November-December 1975), #5-7 (June-September 1976), ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #66 (December 1980), #73-75 (September-November 1981), #97-100 (September-December 1983), #111-113 (November 1984-January 1985), #117 (May 1985), #119 (September 1985), #121-123 (January-May 1986), #125 (September 1986), and ''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #20 (November 1991), #22 (January 1992), #24-25 (March-April 1992), #27-28 (June-July 1992), and #32-33 (November-December 1992).\n\nMaster Khan received an entry in the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #7 (2006).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nKhan was a notable adversary early in [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'s career, fighting Iron Fist, [[Luke Cage]], [[Colleen Wing]], and [[Misty Knight]] on numerous occasions as well as sending his agent [[Scimitar (Marvel Comics)|Scimitar]] against them.  When Khan stole the [[Sons of the Tiger]]'s tiger talismans, he badly injured [[Bob Diamond (comics)|Bob Diamond]].<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #74</ref>\n\nLater, when Iron Fist contracted radiation poisoning, Luke Cage took him to K'un-L'un for treatment.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #118</ref> While there, Iron Fist was secretly replaced by a doppelg\u00e4nger of the plantlike [[H'ylthri]] race, K'un-Lun's ancient enemies. Soon after their return to the outside world, the doppelg\u00e4nger is destroyed as a result of a bizarre scheme engineered by Master Khan.<ref>''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #15-25</ref> Cage is blamed for the apparent murder of Iron Fist.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125</ref>\n\n[[Namor]] traveled to K'un-L'un, where he found Iron Fist, who had been presumed dead for many months. While in stasis with the H'ylthri, Rand managed to focus his chi, curing the cancer. Returning to Earth and investigating the apparent invasion of Earth by the H'ylthri, Namor was forced to fight their captive, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].  The battle was interrupted by Master Khan, who wiped Namor's memory and dumped him in the American Midwest.<ref>''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #25</ref>\n\nNamor was missing for almost a year, until Namorita tracked him down using a psychic link to him she had recently discovered. Namor did not regain his memory until sometime afterward, when he was captured by [[Doctor Doom]]. The ship Doom had used to do so was then magically imprisoned in a bottle by Master Khan, who then assumed Namor's form and sold off much of Oracle's holdings. Namor soon broke the bottle and the spell, and killed Khan.<ref>''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #33</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMaster Khan has magical powers that enable him to distort reality, levitate, and shrink objects and beings.  He can also alter his appearance, form shields, fire energy blasts.  He calls on the mystic principalities, such as Cyttorak, the Faltine, and Raggadorr, for power.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/masterkhankunlun.htm|Master Khan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khan, Master}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1960]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
