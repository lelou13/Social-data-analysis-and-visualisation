He first appeared in ''Galactus: The Devourer'' (1999).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nNothing is known about Red Shift's past before he became the Herald of Galactus. At some point, Galactus became addicted to the consumption of intelligent life. It is unclear whether this occurred before or after Red Shift is empowered as herald, but Red Shift cooperates fully with Galactus's plans. In time, Red Shift attempts to lead Galactus to Earth. He starts by attacking the [[Silver Surfer]], who battles Red Shift for a short while before recognizing that he possesses the [[Power Cosmic]] as one of Galactus's Heralds. He opens a portal to trap the Surfer in a [[black hole]] but was himself trapped when the Surfer destroys one of his swords and confiscated the other.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Annihilation===\nRed Shift joins the other Heralds of Galactus, who are hunted by the forces of [[Annihilus]]'s Annihilation Wave. He works with many other heroes, such as [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Gamora]], [[Cerise (comics)|Cerise]] and [[Star-Lord]]. They lead legions of [[Kree]] and other soldiers in a months long stalemate against the Wave. All, Red Shift included, take their orders from [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]. While Red Shift and fellow herald [[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]] are not fully effective against the forces of the Wave, they are able to keep the airspace clear. The battle against the Annihilation Wave comes to a head at a small planet base.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[Thanos]], a despot who has allied himself with the Wave, gives them the use of teleportation technology.{{issue|date=January 2013}} The base is swiftly overwhelmed.{{issue|date=January 2013}} While the last of the survivors leave, Red Shift and Stardust attempt to hold back a planet-devastating wave generated by Thanos' imprisonment of Galactus. Both are feared lost to the energy.<ref>''Annihilation'' #3</ref>\n\nIt is then revealed that Stardust, being of a race composed entirely of energy, is able to reintegrate himself following his disintegration.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Stardust surmises that Red Shift, not being made of energy, did not survive.<ref>''Heralds of Galactus: Terrax/Stardust''</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike past heralds, Galactus granted Red Shift the [[Power Cosmic]] which allowed him to survive and travel through space, gave him super strength and a number of other abilities. He wielded two swords that could cut holes in space to act as portals to other places. Red Shift was able to open these portals offensively to redirect comets and send foes into black holes.\n\nRed Shift bears a resemblance to [[Beta Ray Bill]], but without verification this can be taken as artistic license instead of an indication that he is of the same race. About this the artist [[Jon J. Muth]] says: \"Beta Ray Bill is a great character, but he had nothing to do with my original character sketches for Red Shift. By the time [[John Buscema]] drew Red Shift in the Galactus mini-series, he had changed a lot.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/redshift.htm|Red Shift}}\n\n{{Silver Surfer}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]"}]}}}}
