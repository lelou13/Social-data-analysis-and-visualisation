For unknown reasons, he was put in stasis.\\n\\nIn the year 2099, he was discovered by a group of foragers led by Packrat, though they were unable to activate him. After surviving an explosion in the city of Nightshade, [[Spider-Man 2099|Spider-Man]] was found and brought to Packrat, who had him attempt to activate the robot, which was successful. As this era\'s Spider-Man did not exist in his outdated records, Flipside extrapolated based on his appearance, configuring himself into a combination of the original [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. Immediately after awakening, Flipside embraced Spider-Man and declared that they would be best friends.<ref>\'\'Spider-Man 2099\'\' #29/1</ref>\\n\\nHowever, Spider-Man rejected Flipside\'s affection, sending the android into a fit of rage. Flipside proceeded to smash the computer systems in Packrat\'s base before slaughtering many of Packrat\'s henchmen.

After Spider-Man departs, Flipside repairs himself and turns on Packrat, giving him a head start.<ref>\'\'Spider-Man 2099\'\' #30/1</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nBeing a combination of Spider-Man and Venom, Flipside demonstrates several of their abilities, such as heightened strength and agility, razor-sharp claws, and shooting organic webbing from the wrists, and without actually seeing Flipside or Miguel one could confuse them for their similar talons, webs, agility, and strength.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Video games===\\n* Flipside is featured as an alternate costume for Spider-Man 2099 in \'\'[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]\'\' and is also mentioned by name.\\n* Flipside is featured as an alternate costume as well for 2099 in \'\'[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]\'\'.\\n* Flipside is also featured as an alternate costume in the 2014 video game \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]\'\'.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\\n[[Category:Marvel 2099 characters]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Fictional clones]]\\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\\n\\n\\n{{marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
