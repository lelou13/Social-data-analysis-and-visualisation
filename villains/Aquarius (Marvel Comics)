Scorpio went after his brother, [[Nick Fury]], with his new group, but was defeated by [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and [[Moon Knight]].<ref>''Defenders'' #48-50</ref> The Zodiac LMD's were recruited by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] during his bout with temporary insanity, and Quicksilver ordered the Zodiac LMD's to destroy [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for their imagined wrongdoings. The Avengers managed to defeat the group and most were remanded into federal custody.<ref>''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #1</ref>\n\nThe android Zodiac were soon released, and the Scorpio LMD rebuilt a number of them. Scorpio used the Zodiac Key to create LMDs that exemplified the forces and personalities inherent in each sign, hoping to create great strength in the combination of all twelve traits of the Zodiac. He arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]]. It was later revealed the Libra had also survived the attack on the original Zodiac Cartel. Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. He was destroyed by Hawkeye in a battle with the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #26-28</ref>\n\nThe Zodiac Key immediately resurrected the Scorpio LMD. Claiming superiority and believing that the Zodiac would eventually kill the Avengers as the androids could never be stopped, Scorpio wanted to use the Key to transport everyone on the scene to the Key's native dimension where the conflict, he believed, could be prolonged indefinitely. However, when the androids were in the other dimension, they ceased to function because each of them were aligned with a particular zodiacal energy, energy that did not exist in the other dimension. The Avengers found [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Tigra]] had been sent to the same dimension and, reunited, the team was sent back to Earth by the Brotherhood. However, secretly the Brotherhood waited so that someday they could also send the Key to Earth again and create new conflicts for them.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #26-28</ref>\n\n===Aquarius (Ecliptic)===\n{{Infobox comics character\n| image=\n|caption=\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\n|character_name=Virgo\n|real_name=\n|species=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''Alpha Flight'' vol. 2 #2\n|creators=\n|alliances=[[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=\n|}}\nAquarius was a later addition to the Zodiac. A man of few words, he tended to remain in the background despite his power.

He appears as a member of the Zodiacs.
