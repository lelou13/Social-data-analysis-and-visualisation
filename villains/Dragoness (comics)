She joined the MLF, going on several strike missions in the name of mutant supremacy.

However, when he wanted to break into a government facility to steal their information on the manufacture of the Legacy Virus, he conscripted Dragoness to his cause.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} Little did the MLF know that a government sanctioned program called [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]] had hidden [[sleeper agent]] [[Prime Sentinel]]s within the [[laboratory]]. Once again, the members of the MLF except [[Forearm (comics)|Forearm]] and [[Danielle Moonstar]] were taken into [[SHIELD]] custody.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\\n\\n===M-Day===\\nAfter the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], where the [[Scarlet Witch]] removed the mutant [[genome]] from over 90% of the world\'s mutant population, Dragoness was one of the few to retain her powers, as listed in the \'\'X-Men: The 198 Files\'\'.
