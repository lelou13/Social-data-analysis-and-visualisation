He is a foe of the [[World\'s Finest Team]]: [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]]. The heroes travel to [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-One]] in the year 1942 to repair damages to the time stream caused by Ravager, a being with the ability to travel through time.  Agent Axis is a [[Nazism|Nazi]] agent who kills Professor Ronsom, an American scientist working on a time travelling device, who is in fact a younger incarnation of the Ravager himself.  He later joins forces with the Ravager in order to bring the secrets of time travel to Nazi Germany.  During a battle in [[Bavaria]] the World\'s Finest Team manages to activate the chronal transponder near the Ravager, returning the heroes to their proper time and place with no memory of the prior events.  Presumably agent Axis is also returned to his correct place and time.<ref>\'\'World\'s Finest Comics\'\' #250 (DC Comics, 1978)</ref>\\n\\n{{Superherobox <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\\n| image =<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:AgentAxisMarvel.jpg|200px]] -->\\n| caption = Agent Axis (Marvel Comics).

The character appeared several times during the \'\'Invaders\'\' series.  Agent Axis also appears in \'\'Marvel Comics Presents\'\' #34 (November 1989).\\n\\nThere is an earlier appearance of a character referred to as \\"Agent Axis\\" but he has no real dialog, plot or significance.  The appearance is in \'\'Tales of Suspense\'\' #82 (1966), a split-book that featured two 10 page installments of Iron Man and Captain America respectively. Published in 1966, this predates the second character by \'\'some eleven years\'\' earlier than the Roy Thomas creation.\\n\\nIn the Captain America story, Cap has been slipped a drug in his coffee by a new villain who has impersonated Tony Stark\'s butler, Jarvis. Cap begins to hallucinate, and sees old foes from WWII emerge from the shadows to attack him in Avengers Mansion. The first of these he identifies as \\"Agent Axis... but I saw you die in World War II... How can this be?\\"  The figure is only shown from behind, wearing a large flowing forest green cloak, with wide brim hat, similar to Lemont Cranston (The Shadow).  The figure vanishes as Cap staggers backwards out of the room, recognizing that it cannot possibly be real.\\n\\n===Fictional character biography===\\nAgent Axis was created when a freak lightning storm merged the bodies of three Axis agents (Hiroyuki Kanegawa, a Japanese agent; Aldo Malvagio, an Italian agent; and Berthold Volker, a Nazi agent) into one body.  The accident gave Agent Axis the strength of three men and ability to speak Japanese, Italian and German, but also left his mind in a fractured state.  He fought the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] several times.\\n\\nAgent Axis reappears after the war.  Former Invaders member the [[Thin Man (comics)|Thin Man]], after discovering that Agent Axis was responsible for killing all the inhabitants of the village of Kalahia, spends the next several decades hunting for the former Nazi agent.  In the 1980s, the Thin Man tracks down Agent Axis to America, where he has been [[Operation Paperclip|given sanctuary]] by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].  The Thin Man enlists the aid of his former ally [[Captain America]] to help bring Agent Axis to justice.  When Agent Axis brags to the Thin Man that he is under protection of the US Government and cannot be brought to trial, the enraged Thin Man snaps the neck of Agent Axis with his pliable body.  Captain America later hands the Thin Man over to the authorities.<ref>\'\'Marvel Comics Presents\'\' #34 (November 1989)</ref>\\n\\nThe soul of Agent Axis is revealed to have been used as the genetic template for producing the Pterorists clones, utilized by the Axis Mundi to assault the New Invaders.<ref>\'\'New Invaders\'\' #1-3 (2004)</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*[http://www.mikesamazingworld.com/database/minorchar-appearances.php?name=Agent%20Axis Agent Axis (DC) at Mike\'s Amazing World of DC Comics]\\n*[http://www.marveldatabase.com/Agent_Axis Agent Axis (Marvel) at the Marvel Database]\\n\\n{{Invaders}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Joe Simon]]\\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Golden Age supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Nazis in comic book fiction]]"}]}}}}'
