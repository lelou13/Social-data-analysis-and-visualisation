A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Unus is named for his ability to consciously project a force field which protects him from harm.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}\nUnus first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' vol. 1 #8 (November 1964), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Origin===\nAngelo Unuscione was born in [[Milan, Italy]]. After his arrival in the United States, he legally changed his name to Gunther Bain.<ref>''Official Handbook of Marvel Universe: Deluxe Edition'' #14</ref> He became a wrestler, and when the Beast briefly left the X-Men, he was able to defeat him in a wrestling match.<ref>''The X-Men'' vol. 1 #8</ref> Once in America, he sought out the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to join them. He turned criminal, and joined with the Brotherhood as they fought the [[X-Men]]. During the battle, his powers were enhanced by a shot fired from Beast's gun, increasing his power beyond his ability to control it, and making him unable to touch anything. He promised to reform, and his normal power level was restored by the Beast.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #8</ref> He became a good friend of the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]],<ref name=\"X-Men vol. 1 #20\">''X-Men'' vol. 1 #20</ref> and they teamed up together on various schemes, such as posing as the X-Men and framing them for robbery,<ref name=\"X-Men vol. 1 #20\"/> before both mutants went their separate ways. It was revealed the alien invader [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]] was behind this, and had made sure the Beast's weapon did not work on Unus anymore.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\n===Factor Three/Brotherhood===\nUnus then joined the villainous organization Factor Three in a conspiracy to conquer Earth. They fought the X-Men, but turned against the [[Mutant Master]] when the latter was exposed as an extraterrestrial.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #37-39</ref> Unus later visited [[Ogre (comics)|Ogre]] at their Mt. Charteris base.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #33</ref> However, shortly after he was captured by [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] alongside several others mutants, but was later released,<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #59-60</ref><ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1 #103</ref> after which he teamed with the Blob and [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] as agents of the second [[Secret Empire]]; they were defeated by the Beast,<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #12-13</ref> and then held prisoner by the Secret Empire.<ref>''Captain America and the Falcon'' #174</ref> Unus then joined an incarnation of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 1 #15</ref> As a member of the Brotherhood, Unus joined in their battle against the X-Men and [[Kruger]].<ref>''X-Men: The Hidden Years'' #11</ref> Alongside the Brotherhood, Unus battled the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], but Magneto and the Brotherhood were reduced to infancy by their team member [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]].<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 1 #15-16</ref> Unus and the others were kept at [[Muir Island]].<ref>''X-Men'' #104</ref> When the Brotherhood was reverted to adulthood and reorganized, Unus teamed with the [[Vanisher]], Blob and Mastermind and fought alongside the group against the [[Champions (comics)|Champions]].<ref>''Champions'' #17</ref> However, he left the team disheartened.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} He came in conflict with [[Doc Samson]],<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #11</ref> and [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], and then embarked on a New York crime spree, but was defeated by [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and Power Man.<ref>''Power Man & Iron Fist'' #90</ref>\n\nNot long after, Unus decided to retire from the life of the organized supervillain, deciding to use his talents in less \"lofty\" ways; he was making a living as a wrestler.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} At some point, he fathered the Canadian mutant [[Radius (comics)|Radius]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} It is also believed that the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolyte]] [[Unuscione|Carmella Unuscione]] is either his daughter or sister, but no official confirmation of this has ever been given.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nComing out of retirement and teaming with his friend the Blob again, Unus discovered, during a fight against the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], that his powers had become nearly uncontrollable, and his field was smashed by the Hulk.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #7</ref> While battling with [[Spider-Man]] in New York, Unus lost complete control of his powers, and his force-field became so thick that it repulsed the very oxygen molecules in the air until he suffocated and passed out. He fell into the arms of Blob, who believed him to be dead.<ref>''Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #91</ref>\n\n===Genosha===\nHowever, years later Unus reappeared alive on the decimated island of [[Genosha]],<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 1 #132</ref> traumatized by the devastation and speaking of \"ghosts.\" Usually arrogant and somewhat fearless, due in no small part to his invulnerable force field, he was shaken by apparent \"ghosts\" being able to pass through it. At some point, he stopped seeing them, and returned to his former hubris.\n\nUnus later formed his own band of mutant rebels (which included Toad and [[Randall Darby|Paralyzer]]), trying to survive on the harsh island that Genosha had become.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 3 #2</ref> They most commonly had arguments with Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto, and surprisingly never recognized Magneto out of costume. In their first confrontation, the mutant known as [[Freakshow (comics)|Freakshow]] ends up literally swallowing Unus in order to end the tensions. His powers protected him.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 3 #2-3</ref>\n\nUnus leads Appraiser and Stripmine, two superhuman poachers, to Genosha<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 3 #5</ref> which caused him to be at odds with all the remaining mutants on Genosha.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 3 #7</ref>\n\n===House of M and death===\nUnus stayed on the island until before the [[House of M]],{{Issue|date=June 2009}} and was depowered after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nUnus is later found by Quicksilver on Genosha. Quicksilver granted him his powers back, however in an altered form.<ref>''Son of M'' #5</ref> The [[Office of National Emergency]] soon stepped in and took the mists from Quicksilver and his daughter. [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]] managed to teleport Luna and Pietro away before ONE could capture them, leaving a battle between the Inhumans and the repowered mutants of Genosha. During the battle Unus faced [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], who was amazed that he could not break Unus's shield. However, Unus's powers soon evolved beyond his control and a pink metallic shell began to form all over his body. Both the Inhumans and the repowered mutants tried to save Unus's life, but it was too late. As Unus's field began to dissolve, it was discovered that he had died from lack of oxygen.<ref>''Son of M'' #6</ref>\n\n===Necrosha===\nUnus was among the many on the island of Genosha who have been resurrected by Eli Bard and his version of the techno-organic virus. He appeared seemingly repowered by the T.O. virus.<ref>''X-Force'' #21</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nUnus the Untouchable is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] that possessed the power to generate a field of invisible psionic energy around his body. The field acts to deflect objects and even energy beams, and can withstand great concussive force. Normally, Unus can control the force field at will. Normally, certain types of radiant energy, such as sunlight, can pass through the field, as do air and sound waves (at least within certain unknown limits). Unus has deflected beams of energy, objects of high mass, objects traveling at high speed and telepathy, including that of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]. Unus was at one point vulnerable to the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'s ray gun that augmented his force field power beyond his control;{{Issue|date=June 2011}} in later years Unus's power again became uncontrollable due to unknown reasons, finally repelling air molecules.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}\n\nUnus's force field was not impenetrable, and could be disrupted by a sufficiently powerful force. The Incredible Hulk did this on two occasions, the first time by simply shattering it with a punch enhanced by his anger.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' vol. 1 #7</ref> When they battled again in Australia during the [[House of M]] crossover, the Hulk created a sonic boom by clapping his hands, which resonated with Unus's force field and cause shockwaves that stunned the villain.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #84</ref> Although it was temporarily disrupted, the force field would eventually regenerate itself.\n\nUnus is also an athletic man and an expert wrestler. Unus sometimes carried a baseball bat, which, when encased in his force field, can deliver blows with superhuman force.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nUnus in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] (also known as Earth-295) was a Prelate in [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] Infinites. Prelate Unus's appearance was cut short, however, as he was frozen by [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and shattered.<ref>''X-Men Alpha''</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nUnus also appeared briefly within the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe|Ultimate Universe]] as a member of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]]. In this version, he had some sort of astral projection powers. In ''[[The Ultimates 3]]'', Unus is charged with protecting Magneto's citadel from the [[Ultimates]]. His forcefield deflects blows from [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]], but ultimately, Thor broke through and apparently killed Unus for defying a god.<ref> ''Ultimates'' vol.3 #4</ref>\n\n===House of M===\nIn the \"House of M\", Unus was a lieutenant of Exodus and was eradicating the remaining human population in Australia. However, while tracking several runaway humans he stumbled upon and attempted to destroy a tribe of Aborigines who had adopted the Hulk into their midst. In the ensuing conflict, Unus was severely injured and put in a hospital.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #83</ref>\n\n===X-Men Noir===\nIn ''[[Marvel Noir|X-Men Noir]]'', Angelo Unuscione is an unpowered human and a dangerous mob boss known as \"Unus the Untouchable\".<ref>''X-Men Noir'' #2-4</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Unus|Unus}}\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/u/unus.htm Unus the Untouchable at Marvel Directory]\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/unusuntouchx.htm|Unus the Untouchable}}\n\n{{X-Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Unus The Untouchable}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Fictional immigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Fictional Italian people]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Marvel characters]]"}]}}}}
