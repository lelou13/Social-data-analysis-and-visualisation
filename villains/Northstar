He is the twin brother of [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]]. Through his [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutation]], Northstar gains superhuman powers, which he uses for the betterment of society. Although originally a member of [[Alpha Flight]], a fictional team of [[Canada|Canadian]] superhumans, Northstar is later portrayed as a member of the [[X-Men]]. He is one of the first openly [[homosexuality|gay]] superheroes in [[American comic book]]s, and the first openly gay character to come out in a book published by Marvel Comics. He married his partner, Kyle Jinadu, in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' #51, published June 27, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Avery|first=Dan|title=Gay Wedding Bells Are Gonna Chime In The Pages Of X-Men|url=http://www.queerty.com/gay-wedding-bells-are-gonna-chime-in-the-pages-of-x-men-20120316/|publisher=Queerty|date=March 16, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===1979\u20131994===\nNorthstar debuted in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #120 (April 1979) as part of the Canadian government sponsored team [[Alpha Flight]], who seek to take [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] of the X-Men into custody. In 1983, Alpha Flight went on to star in its own comic, with Northstar as a charter member. In addition to the ''Alpha Flight'' comic and associated annuals, Northstar and other members of the team made numerous guest appearances in other titles, particularly ''Uncanny X-Men'' and ''Wolverine''. Northstar was also featured in miniseries including two ''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' series and ''[[Secret Wars II]]''.\n\nCreator [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] was reluctant to produce an initial run of the 1983 ''Alpha Flight'' comic series for lack of developed and compelling characters, which had no back-stories and were created as nothing more than a team to face the X-Men. So in order to make the team less two-dimensional and more developed, Northstar's sexual orientation was subtly introduced into the start of the new ''Alpha Flight'' series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=20713 |work=Byrne Robotics |title=Jim Shooter'\u0092s views on homosexuality in comics }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelygods.com/h/80s.html |publisher=Lonely Gods: Homosexuals in Comics |title=The 1980s }}</ref> Although Byrne had intended the character to be gay, he was restricted to implied hints of this fact,<ref name=\"Byrne\">{{cite web |last=Byrne |first=John |url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#106 |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Was NorthStar always intended to be a gay character? |publisher=Byrne Robotics |accessdate=April 11, 2009 }}</ref> due to Marvel editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]]'s policy against openly homosexual characters,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bartilucci |first=Vinnie |title=One Thin Dime an' Two Thick Pennies (Jim Shooter interview) |work=Thwack! }}</ref> and by the [[Comics Code Authority]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Nyberg |first=Amy Kiste |title=Seal of Approval: The History of the Comics Code |location=[[Jackson, Mississippi]] |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=1998 |pages=143, 175\u2013176 |isbn=0-87805-975-X }}</ref> Thus, Northstar's apparent lack of interest in women was implied to be due to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion,<ref name=\"rzero\">{{citation |url=http://www.rzero.com/books/gaysuperfull.html |title=Beek's Books \u2014 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Superheroes |publisher=Rzero.com |date= |accessdate=March 21, 2009 }}</ref> and writer [[Bill Mantlo]]'s later attempt to reveal that Northstar had [[AIDS]] was squelched.<ref>{{cite web |last=David |first=Peter |url=http://www.peterdavid.net/index.php/2004/11/23/when-you-wish-upon-northstar/ |title=But I Digress...: When You Wish Upon Northstar |publisher=PeterDavid.net |date=February 14, 1992 |accessdate=April 11, 2009 }}</ref> In ''Alpha Flight'' #106 (1992), writer [[Scott Lobdell]] was finally given permission to have Northstar state, \"I am gay.\"<ref name='rzero'/><ref name=\"Furey\">{{cite web |last=Furey |first=Emmett |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=10809 |title=Homosexuality in Comics \u2014 Part II |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=April 11, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"Advocate 1019\">{{citation |last=Col\u00f3n |first=Suzan |date=November 18, 2008 |title=Don't Mask, Do Tell |work=[[The Advocate]] |pages=18 |issue=1019  |url=http://www.advocate.com/issue_story_ektid63952.asp |accessdate=November 30, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAs the first major, openly gay character created by Marvel Comics, Northstar generated significant publicity in the mainstream press<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/24/opinion/the-comics-break-new-ground-again.html |title=Op-Ed: The Comics Break New Ground, Again |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 24, 1992 |accessdate=April 11, 2009 }}</ref> and ''Alpha Flight'' #106 sold out in a week, despite the fact that the series was not a very popular title.<ref name=\"Furey\"/> It is the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the [[Gaylactic Spectrum Awards#Hall of Fame|Gaylactic Hall of Fame]].<ref name=locspec02>{{citation |url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Spectrum22002.html |title=2002 Gaylactic Spectrum Awards |accessdate=2008-11-13 |first=Mark R. |last=Kelly|year=2002 |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> The event was also controversial,<ref>{{cite web |last=Masaki |first=Lyle |url=http://www.afterelton.com/blog/lylemasaki/seven-major-gay-moments-from-marvel-history |title=The Seven Biggest Gay Moments in Marvel Comics History |work=[[AfterElton.com]] |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=April 11, 2009 }}</ref> and almost no mention was made of his sexual orientation for the remainder of the first ''Alpha Flight'' series, which ended with issue #130 in 1994.

Jean-Paul is later adopted, but his adopted parents are killed after only a couple of years.  Prior to his debut as a superhero, Beaubier competes as a professional skier.  He became an elite level skier during his teenage years, prior to his mutation surfacing.  Once he develops his [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] abilities he becomes virtually unbeatable and eventually bores of the sport due to the lack of competition.  He becomes an angry and rebellious youth and, as a young adult, joins the [[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec]], a [[terrorism|terrorist]] separatist movement organized to win independence for [[Quebec]] from [[Canada]].  However, he soon becomes disgusted with the group's tactics and renounces terrorism. Beaubier then learns of a superhero group financed by the Canadian government called [[Alpha Flight]]. He then reunites with his sister Jeanne-Marie, who takes the name Aurora.\n\n===Alpha Flight===\nJean-Paul joins Alpha Flight, adopting the codename Northstar.  It is there that he is reunited with his twin sister Jeanne-Marie (\u201cAurora\u201d).  Northstar's debut occurs in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #120, in which he is a member of Alpha Flight combating the [[X-Men]] to capture former teammate [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #120-121</ref>\n\nAlpha Flight learns that it is being disbanded, and Jean-Paul is shocked when he witnesses his sister\u2019s [[multiple personality disorder|split personalities]].  He encounters his old friend Raymond Belmonde, a man who took him in and mentored him, helping him become comfortable with himself and steering him on the right path.  He introduces Aurora to Belmonde only for the twins to be attacked by local crime boss [[Deadly Ernest#Deadly Ernest (Ernest St. Ives)|Deadly Ernest]], who kills Belmonde.  The twins deal with the villain, though their relationship sours when Northstar offends Aurora by asking if she had \u201cromanced her way to safety.\u201d  Aurora refuses to speak with him after that, and her lover and teammate [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] assists her in altering her powers such that she no longer needs Northstar to generate light.  Her attempts to isolate him cause Northstar to quit Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1, 7, 8, 18</ref>\n\nEventually, Aurora arrives at his doorstep, seeking his help.  The twins begin to reconcile, but Aurora rejects him again when she discovers Jean-Paul\u2019s history as a terrorist with the FLQ, telling the other members of Alpha Flight.  They cross-examine him about his terrorist activities, though any discussion is dropped due to an emergency.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #25</ref>  When Sasquatch dies, the twins reconcile after Northstar comforts his grieving sister.  However, during a confrontation with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Northstar and Aurora discover that her power alterations cause the twins to negate one another\u2019s abilities upon touching.  After the battle finishes, Northstar decides to rejoin Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #29</ref>\n\nWhile on a skiing vacation, Northstar is forced to publicly expose himself as a mutant to save a woman's life.   Spectators accuse the retired skiing champion of using his powers to cheat.  Realizing that he could not know if he had subconsciously used his abilities in the past, he relinquishes his medals and bitterly turns his back on skiing forever.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #41</ref>\n\nThe villain [[Pestilence (comics)|Pestilence]] senses decay in Northstar's body and causes his sickness to grow serious to the point that his wounds no longer heal, slowly killing him.  As his illness progresses, Aurora desperately uses her healing light to cure him.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #50</ref>  The twins' later use of their powers on one another stabilizes their abilities back to their original state, also allowing Northstar to generate light independently like Aurora.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #85</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Northstar (X-Men).png|thumb|left|110px|Northstar in the uniform he wore after joining the X-Men.

Doctors discover that the baby girl is dying of [[AIDS]], having been infected with [[HIV]] in the womb.  Jean-Paul adopts her and names her Joanne Beaubier, and he and Alpha Flight performed various events to remind the public of AIDS and the dangers of remaining silent about it.  Her death weeks later spurs Northstar to publicly acknowledge that he is homosexual, hoping that his role as a gay man and a celebrity will increase media attention on HIV/AIDS safety and prevention.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #106</ref>\n\nEventually Northstar decides to leave Alpha Flight and writes a memoir about his experience as a mutant and gay man entitled ''Born Normal''.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #392</ref>\n\n===X-Men===\nIn the 2001 [[X-Men: Eve of Destruction|Eve of Destruction]] story arc, Northstar is briefly recruited to an improvised team of X-Men by [[Jean Grey]] to rescue [[Professor X]], who has been captured by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and is being kept prisoner in [[Genosha]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #392 (2001)</ref> Jean meets Northstar at a book-signing appearance, where he is mobbed.

This man is very homophobic and it leads to an actual fight between the two on the driveway of the X-Men's mansion.{{issue|date=September 2011}}\n\nAt Professor Xavier's request, Northstar then works with the X-Men to save the life of a mutant child who cannot stop exploding. Despite his speed, Northstar cannot save the boy, who perishes simply because of his powers. Soon afterwards, Northstar officially joins the X-Men<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #414 (2002)</ref> and becomes an instructor at the Xavier Institute, teaching business, economics, and French. He is also shown teaching flying classes. Northstar becomes a mentor to his own squad of young mutants, [[Alpha Squadron (comics)|Alpha Squadron]], and forms a close mentor relationship with student [[Anole (comics)|Anole]]. During his time at Xavier's, he forms a close friendship with [[Annie Ghazikhanian]], a former nurse at the Xavier Institute. Annie realizes that Northstar has developed an attraction to [[Iceman (comics)|Bobby Drake]]. Bobby remains oblivious, despite Northstar, who was currently sick, saving him from the misguided anger of a jealous mutant.{{issue|date=September 2011}}\n\nWhen [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] forms an alliance with the cults the [[Dawn of the White Light]] and the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], the groups start recruiting new agents from the superhero community by killing, resurrecting, and brainwashing them.  The X-Man [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is one of their victims, brainwashed into becoming a HYDRA assassin. He eventually attacks the X-Men and kills Northstar. One of the [[New Mutants]], [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]], manages to heal Northstar's wounds but is unable to revive him. A few days later a statue of Northstar is created in memory of him and is placed in a garden of statues of various fallen X-Men on the campus grounds. S.H.I.E.L.D. requests that Northstar be decapitated in order to prevent a [[resurrection]], but before anything can happen, Northstar's body is stolen by [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], another brainwashed victim of HYDRA.  A resurrected Northstar leads an attack with Elektra on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]], crippling S.H.I.E.L.D. and putting [[Nick Fury]] in critical condition. Northstar also takes the time to kill racists and homophobes all across the country, and makes use of his regained 'flash', the ability to generate a brief blinding light. Wolverine meets Northstar, but is taken prisoner by the other Dawn of the White Light mutants, all of whom he kills except for Northstar. When Northstar refuses to tell Wolverine the location of HYDRA's command center, Wolverine knocks him out and calls S.H.I.E.L.D. to pick him up and psychologically \"deprogram\" him. [[Nick Fury]] reports that Northstar's body was not found and he is presumed dead, while actually being in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #31</ref>\n\nNot long afterward, the mysterious group of superhumans known as the [[Children of the Vault]] abducts Northstar from the S.H.I.E.L.D. holding facility in order to use him to kill their enemies, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and the X-Men. They easily are able to mentally control Northstar due to the Hand's previous mental manipulations leaving his psyche fragile. Under their control he then finds his sister about to commit suicide and stops her so that The Children can mentally control her too. Together they attack the school under The Children's command and make quick work of several X-Men, notably [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and Anole, whose encounter with Northstar briefly shakes him from mind-control.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #190</ref> Leaving Aurora to battle the X-Men, Northstar begins a search for Sabretooth but is stopped by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. The X-Men take Northstar and Aurora to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier in an attempt to fix the mental damage inflicted on the twins. Using their [[Virtual reality|V.R.]] equipment the X-Men allow the twins to relive their lives at an accelerated pace. The process is interrupted near the end of the session by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], creating a telepathic connection between the twins. Using each other's emotional support they apparently manage to face their inner turmoils. This allows both brother and sister to gain a higher level of control of their powers.<ref>''X-Men Annual'' #1 (2007)</ref>\n\n=== X-Men split and reformation ===\n<!-- [[Arcs: Divided We Stand, [[Secret Invasion]], Utopia]] -->\nNorthstar is later contacted by Cyclops to find Anole, who goes into hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to post traumatic stress disorder from his time at the X-Mansion. Northstar discovers Anole on a tree limb beside a tree house, the teenager not too happy to see his former mentor. At first, Jean-Paul makes jokes, thinking Victor is having a problem with fitting in, as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Victor explains that his town accepts him for who he is \u2013 his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for stealing the New X-Men's innocence. Just before Anole departs, he elbows Jean-Paul in the face \u2013 similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past \u2013 and tells him to tell all of the former New X-Men not to come looking for him.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nNorthstar and his sister Aurora respond to [[Emma Frost]]'s telepathic [[All-points bulletin|APB]] and fight alongside the X-Men in San Francisco against the Skrulls when they invade Earth.<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #2</ref> However, Jean-Paul also makes a life for himself outside of superheroics, having returned to being a star at extreme snowsports, as well as starting his own brand of snow sporting equipment and becoming involved in a relationship. Wolverine then approaches him to rejoin the X-Men to help fill a much needed [[speedster (fiction)|speedster]] role on the team. After receiving confirmation that he would not be the team's token gay member, he accepts.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #508</ref>\n\nLater while training [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] in the use of super-speed, Northstar stops to give an interview. During the interview he finds out about [[Simon Trask]]'s Proposition X. He runs back to the X-Men and threatens to quit and go back to Canada. However, he remains with the X-Men throughout several missions,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #511</ref> including confrontations with [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark X-Men]]<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia'' #1</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #514</ref><ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus'' #1</ref> and a rescue mission to retrieve [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] after she is banished to [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] during the events of ''[[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]]''.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming - Revelations: Hellbound''</ref>\n\nA temporal copy of Northstar\u2014from a period of time shortly before the apparent death of [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]] at the hands of [[Jerry Jaxon]]\u2014was introduced near the end of the third ''Alpha Flight'' series, along with an entire team of early Alpha Flight members.{{issue|date=November 2010}} This Northstar is last seen with a similarly time-displaced Aurora, still operating in the Earth-616 present.{{issue|date=November 2010}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Northstar alongside Aurora, Sasquatch, and Snowbird are reunited with a resurrected Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and Marrina Smallwood, and they reform [[Alpha Flight]].<ref>''Chaos War: Alpha Flight'' #1</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\n[[File:Northstar and Aurora.jpg|Northstar and Aurora. Art by Leinil Francis Yu.|200px|thumb]]\n\nNorthstar is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who can move and fly at superhuman speed with the potential of reaching near light speeds.  He also possesses superhuman stamina, endurance (both essential to maintain super-speed for any length of time), and reflexes. He can channel a portion of the kinetic energy of the atomic motion in his body's molecules in a single direction, accelerating his body to a velocity in direct proportion to the amount of kinetic energy he has tapped. Northstar also has an advanced [[sense of balance|equilibrium]], and exceptional agility, reaction time, and coordination which allows for him to make sharp turns, and run at such speeds without becoming sick. Northstar is also able to punch at great speeds, which grants him the ability to hurt even the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. In an early issue of Alpha Flight Northstar reveals to readers that his sister [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]] has greater endurance and can fly longer, whereas he can fly faster in the same amount of time.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1 (1983)</ref> Northstar can create cyclones by running in circles, can run up walls and across water, and can breathe while traveling at supersonic speeds. However, if Northstar wanted to travel with someone else at superhuman speeds, they would need a breathing apparatus to keep from asphyxiating.\n\nAs a side effect of partially robbing his molecules of their atomic motion, the binding forces within and between the molecules increase which enhances the sheer toughness of Northstar's entire body.  This effect gives his skin enough durability to withstand speeds up to at least Mach 10 without injury, but the upper limit of this ability has not been measured.  It had once been theorized that Northstar could fly at 99% of the speed of light: {{convert|186282|mi/s|km/s}},{{Issue|date=January 2010}} although this has never been attempted because he would do irreparable damage to the environment.  While Northstar can withstand Mach 10 speeds, traveling any faster would carry complications with breathing and damage caused by wind and air resistance to his body.  When Aurora, his sister, and Northstar are in contact with each other, usually by holding hands, they can also vary the rate of acceleration of his molecules to release a cascade of photons creating a momentary burst of light equal to one million [[candela]] which they use to blind their opponents. The only other minor drawback to this ability, other than he and his sister having to be in contact with each other to utilize this gift, is that they are unable to adjust the brilliance of the flash. After being captured by the Children of the Vault in the Supernovas arc of Mike Carey's ''X-Men'', his and Aurora's powers have been enhanced to the point where they can now move at light speed without harm and can generate explosive thermal energy in addition to light.<ref>''X-Men'' #189</ref><ref>''X-Men'' #190</ref>\n\nNorthstar is a world-class professional skier, skilled trapeze artist, business man, and an accomplished novelist.  A native French speaker, he is also fluent in English. He is a good hand-to-hand combatant using a style utilizing his superhuman speed, and received coaching from his teammate [[Puck (comics)|Puck]].

The siblings are rather snotty about their superior status as mutants and seem to take great pleasure in punishing those prisoners who act up or try to escape. When the E.M.F.'s leader, Cyclops, switches sides, secretly helping some inmates to escape, he is caught in the act by the speeding twins.  However, both of them are defeated by Cyclops and the prisoner he was helping to escape, which happens to be [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]].

In fact, his unnatural levels of speed are actually due to his mutation.  When the X-Men reveal to him he is a mutant and ask him to join them, he turns them down, saying that separating themselves from humans is segregation and noting how a student there ([[Beast (comics)|Beast]]) had been recently killed.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #46</ref>\n\nSoon after, [[Mister Sinister#Ultimate Marvel|Mister Sinister]], a deranged man who is apparently under orders of [[Alternative versions of Apocalypse#Ultimate Apocalypse|Apocalypse]] to kill ten mutants, shoots Northstar.
