His first appearance was in \'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #31.\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nOrphan-Maker\'s first appearance was in \'\'X-Factor\'\' #31 (August 1988), and he was created by [[Louise Simonson]] and [[Walt Simonson]].\\n\\nThe character subsequently appears in \'\'X-Factor\'\' #35 (December 1988), #40 (May 1989), \'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #247-248 (August-September 1989), #265-267 (August-September 1990), \'\'Generation X\'\' #2-4 (December 1994-February 1995), \'\'Generation X Holiday Special\'\' #1 (February 1998), \'\'Slingers\'\' #9 (August 1999), and \'\'Wolverine: Killing Made Simple\'\' #1 (October 2008).\\n\\nOrphan-Maker received an entry in the \'\'[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update \'89]]\'\' #5.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nLittle is known of Orphan-Maker\'s past but apparently, Peter was held captive in [[Mister Sinister]]\'s \\"orphanage\\" for unknown reasons{{Fact|date=May 2009}}. Mr. Sinister had instead decided that Peter was too uncontrollable and must be killed. Saved by the [[cyborg]] [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]], he became the first of her \\"Lost Boys (and Girls)\\". Under Nanny\'s direction, Peter, as the Orphan-Maker, began to kill the parents of young mutants (and thus \\"orphaning\\" them)  and abducting them for Nanny.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}\\n\\nThey would confront the X-Men operating out of a small, faux-town in the Australian outback. [[Dazzler]] and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] are ambushed and stunned in a ship designed to look like a crash-landed artifact. The captured are physically converted into children. They are given battlesuits themselves and convinced to attack the other X-Men. Some assistance is given by [[Jubilation Lee|Jubilee]], whom the X-Men did not know of at the time. {{Issue|date=May 2009}}\\n\\nOrphan-Maker and Nanny are temporarily defeated after [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] rescues Havok from his battlesuit. Confused and disoriented from his experience, Havok blasts Nanny\'s ship, causing much destruction and seemingly causing the death of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]. However, Orphan-Maker and Nanny had left behind a dead body that looked like Storm, while de-aging and kidnapping her.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\\n\\nThe pair would later confront [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], a super-team made up of the five original X-Men.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\\n\\nDuring an incident where a mentally ill young mutant had taken hostages inside his school, Orphan-Maker was driven away partly because the mutant [[Skin (Marvel Comics)|Skin]] managed to interfere with his suit\'s energy flow. He managed to escape pursuit in a technologically advanced vehicle disguised as an ice cream truck.<ref>\'\'[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\nMost recently, he and Nanny battled with Wolverine after they tried to make Trance an orphan. <ref>\'\'[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]\'\' Killing Made Simple</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nOrphan-Maker is a mutant, but has yet to exhibit powers aside from those of his hi-tech battle suit. Also, he remains intellectually a child.\\n\\n===Battle Suit===\\nOrphan-Maker\'s armor is highly resistant to most forms of attack, and has certain reflective properties that allow him to deflect energy attacks such as [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]\' optic blasts. The suit also enhances his strength, and may suppress his mutant powers{{Fact|date=May 2009}}. Orphan-Maker is equipped with large guns that fire destructive energies. When he was outfitted with his new armor, the suit had the capability of forming guns out of its hands.\\n\\n==Footnotes==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/orphanmakerpeter.htm|Orphan-Maker}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Louise Simonson]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Walt Simonson]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
