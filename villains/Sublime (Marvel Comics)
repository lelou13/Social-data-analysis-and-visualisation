Sublime first appeared as John Sublime in the ''[[New X-Men]] [[Annual publication|Annual]] 2001''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Early history===\nSublime is the self-appointed name of a sentient [[bacteria]]l lifeform that arose during the beginnings of life on [[Earth]]. With the rise of [[Multicellular organism|multicellular lifeforms]], Sublime found endless numbers of hosts it could infect. However, [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutantkind]], some of whom were immune to Sublime's infection, eventually arose and multiplied, becoming the first threat to Sublime's domination.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}\n\nIt was hinted that the very hatred and fear of mutants was caused by Sublime itself. But the bacteria took more direct actions in order to ensure that the mutant population would be held in check, if not exterminated, in order to keep them from becoming the dominant species of the planet.<ref name=\"xmen154\">''New X-Men'' #154</ref>\n\n===Weapon Plus===\nThe first step was the [[Weapon Plus]] Project, Sublime took over a human body, dubbed Dr. John Sublime, and became the director of the Program, overseeing the creation of living weapons created by each installation of the program, from [[Captain America]] (Weapon I) to the ''Super-Sentinels'' - [[Fantomex]], [[Huntsman (comics)|Huntsman]] and [[Ultimaton]] (Weapon XIII, Weapon XII and Weapon XV), passing through [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], the latter two originating in the [[Weapon X]] Project, seemingly the most prolific living weapons producer.<ref>''New X-Men'' #145</ref>\n\nFor many years, Sublime remained behind the scenes, manipulating the Weapon Plus Project and installing [[Malcolm Colcord]] as the Director of Weapon X, which would eventually lead to the so-called ''War of the Programs'' between Colcord's replacement, Agent [[Brent Jackson]], and Sublime, as Weapon X became an independent organization.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}\n\n===TransSpecies Movement===\nAs millions of mutants were born worldwide, Sublime, still under the identity of John Sublime, took other steps to ensure the extermination of mutantkind. One of these steps was the creation of the ''TransSpecies Movement'' a.k.a. ''Homo Perfectus'', outwardly a group of 'mutants born in human bodies', though actually a cult of humans that sought to empower themselves by grafting mutant body parts to their own bodies. The militant faction of this group, the [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]], refused to have any sort of contact with the world, which they considered impure, for which they sealed themselves in containment suits.<ref name=\"annual\">''New X-Men Annual'' 2001</ref>\n\nDuring a trip to [[Hong Kong]]'s new office of the [[X-Corporation]] to investigate the murder of [[Risque (comics)|Risque]], the [[X-Men]] discovered Sublime's farm of mutant prisoners. They were being harvested for mutant body parts which could give the U-Men powers. Sublime, who was in the country on a book tour, thus became aware of the X-Men's immediate threat to his plans. Sublime also tried to purchase the mutant healer [[Xorn]] in one such prison in [[China]].<ref name=\"annual\"/>\n\nAlthough Xorn was rescued by the X-Men, he was actually a mole. Xorn, who was revealed to apparently be [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], became addicted to the drug Kick (which was actually Sublime's bacterial body in concentrated doses high-enough to finally enable the infection and possession of a mutant). Xorn dealt the drug to [[Quentin Quire]], thus placing Quire under Sublime's influence, which would cause the Open Day Riots made by the Omega Gang, and which led to the death of Sophie of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] and [[Dummy (comics)|Dummy]], the bodiless, gaseous-form student of Xorn.<ref>''New X-Men'' #137</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Sublime and the U-Men spread their influence to [[New York City]], where they kidnapped the telepath [[Martha Johansson]], harvested her still-living brain, and used it as a weapon against the X-Men. Cyclops and [[Emma Frost]], the White Queen, were kidnapped and tortured. They were sent off to be dissected but escaped and confronted Sublime in his office. Emma, angry, held Sublime off a high ledge. Johansson forced Sublime to fall from Emma Frost's grip to his apparent death. The Sublime organism survived, regenerated its host body, and returned to actively overseeing Weapon Plus, as always, from the shadows.<ref>''New X-Men'' #120</ref>\n\nSublime suffered a setback in its plans with the destruction of two of Weapon Plus' ''Super-Sentinels'' ([[Huntsman (comics)|Huntsman]]/Weapon XII and [[Ultimaton]]/Weapon XV) and the defection of Fantomex (Weapon XIII). Sublime had envisioned a team of mutant-hunters with scripted actions operating from a space station (a section of [[Asteroid M]]) in order to make the genocide of mutantkind look like a \"[[Saturday morning cartoon]] come to life\".  Weapon XII had already been destroyed during its test-drive; Fantomex, intended to be the smart, cool member of the team refused to be anybody's weapon. Only Ultimaton remained, and even though he followed the direction of Weapon Plus operatives, he had begun to question his role as a slaughter machine but was ultimately killed by Wolverine.<ref>''New X-Men'' #146</ref>\n\nUnder the influence of Sublime via Kick, Xorn revealed himself to be Magneto, and assembled a new [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] to lay waste to the Xavier Institute and then New York City. They were defeated by the X-Men, but Xorn-Magneto, under Sublime's influence, killed [[Jean Grey]], who was manifesting the powers of the [[Phoenix Force]]. Unbeknownst to all, the Phoenix was the ultimate threat to Sublime's plan. In retaliation for Jean's murder, Xorn-Magneto was beheaded by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #150</ref>\n\nLater, [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]], an X-Man who had infiltrated Colcord's Weapon X organization, was ordered to assassinate Sublime by Brent Jackson, a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent turned Weapon X field leader. Chamber incinerated Sublime, but Sublime again regenerated. At the same time, Sublime was also responsible for sending [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] against [[Mister Sinister]] in order to obtain Sinister's latest creations, the Children (not to be confused with the Children of the Vault, a thematically similar team of characters but different in origin).{{Issue|date=May 2011}}\n\nWith the massive [[Decimation (comics)|depowering]] of mutants following the [[House of M]], mutantkind's threat to Sublime has been greatly diminished. However, it remains to be seen if the depowered mutants lost their innate immunity to the Sublime infection. In any event, Sublime appears as a computer-generated image and personality in ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong]]'' where he greets the remaining Stepford Cuckoos at The World, the base of operations for the Weapon Plus.  He confirms that the Cuckoos are part of the larger Weapon XIV, the \"Thousand-in-One,\" a telepathic gestalt of one thousand cloned daughters based on the [[ovum|ova]] of Emma Frost, taken by John Sublime years earlier when she was comatose.  He facilitates the transfer of the Phoenix Force into all one thousand clones and uses robots to stop the X-Men, though \"he\" is defeated.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong'' #1 - 5</ref>\n\n===''X-Men: Nation X'' and ''X-Men: Quarantine''===\nLater, a team composed of five superpowered individuals, named as [[Lobe (comics)|Lobe]], [[Verre (comics)|Verre]], [[Burst (comics)|Burst]], [[Thug (comics)|Thug]] and [[Bouncing Betty (comics)|Bouncing Betty]], came into conflict against the X-Men. Their true motivation remained a mystery, but they claimed that they wanted to save the world's mutant population.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}\n\nTo that end, they kidnapped a clone of the Marauder known as Scalphunter, and forced him to deliver five Predator X's which Lobe had previously created and modified. Although all the Predators were successfully delivered to [[Asteroid M#Fifth version|Utopia]], they were killed by the X-Men, however, unknown to the X-Men, upon dying, the Predators would release trillions of microscopic devices made to spy on each mutant and learn all about them, their powers, and anything else they could.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #515 - 519</ref>\n\nWhen [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Psylocke]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Fantomex]] find and defeat this mysterious team, they claim to be working for Sublime before they send a virus in the air forcing the X-Men to retreat from their facility.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #520 - 521</ref>\n\nDuring the ''X-Men: Quarantine'' story arc <ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #530-534</ref> it is revealed that the virus was a mutant-targeted flu, codename \"HX-N1\" or \"mutant flu\" designed to dampen mutant powers and force Cyclops to put Utopia under lockdown, leaving the few mutants on the mainland to form an ad hoc X-Men team while a cure was researched.{{issue|date=December 2012}} \n\nMaking their move, the villains, with Lobe in the position as CEO of the Sublime Corporation debut their own \"X-Men\", a group of normal humans bearing the powers of the original five X-Men (Beast, Angel, Jean Grey, Iceman, and Cyclops). The powers were temporarily introduced by a special drug, \"Xperience\", designed with the data gathered from the Predator X feint. The false X-Men serve as poster children for the company's attempt to commercialize mutant powers and sell the drug, an initiative titled \"You, X-Men\" (a riff off of John Sublime's own \"U-Men\"). At a demonstration Lobe drinks a dose, gaining the optical blasts of Cyclops, and distributes free samples to a crowd of investors in order to fight off a strike team of X-Men, and demonstrate the product in action. \"Wolverine\" and \"Deadpool\"(though Deadpool is not technically a mutant) prove most popular.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe group's plan fails when Cyclops breaks the quarantine to confront Lobe in person. Lobe activates the virus' life-threatening \"[[Ebola]] plus\" function, nearly killing the X-Men, as well as Lobe himself and the gathered guests. As it turned out Lobe and the guests' imbibing of Xperience temporarily made ''them'' mutants as well, and thus vulnerable to the now-deadly virus. Lobe is forced to deactivate his disease and is captured.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Arkea===\nSublime returned in the first issue of volume 4 of X-Men. He comes to willingly surrender to the X-Men as they have been the greatest threat to him before and as such he sees them as the best hope of stopping his sister, the technological bacterium Arkea, from invading and taking over Earth.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 4 #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nSublime isn't a typical sapient but a gestalt microscopic colony that can possess the body of any living organism and manipulate both psyche and substance however he sees fit. Other abilities he has access to are mass mind control, genetic manipulation which stems towards accelerated healing along with Cellular shape shifting as well as performing any number of power enhancements upon any mutants he possesses. Given that they've taken his inhalable form as the power boosting drug Kick.\n\n==List of hosts==\n* '''John Sublime''': Sublime's main host body, which the bacteria uses as its cover identity. This body has appeared a number of times even after being killed.\n* '''[[Quentin Quire|Kid Omega]]''': Sublime came into possession of Quentin Quire after he began to consume the drug Kick and influenced him into causing the Open Day's riots.\n* '''[[Tattoo (comics)|Tattoo]]''': Influenced after consuming Kick.\n* '''[[Glob Herman]]''': Influenced after consuming Kick.\n* '''[[Radian (comics)|Radian]]''': Influenced after consuming Kick.\n* '''[[Redneck (comics)|Redneck]]''': Influenced after consuming Kick.\n* '''[[Xorn]]''': Xorn's rampage through New York and the murder of Jean Grey were seemingly caused by Sublime's influence.\n* '''[[Beast (comics)|Beast]]''': The most powerful life-form he could find in the alternate ''[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]'' reality.\n* '''[[Fantomex]]''': In the alternate ''[[Weapon X: Days of Future Now|Days of Future Now]]'' timeline.\n* '''[[Empath (comics)|Empath]]''': [[Elias Bogan]] provided Empath with Kick in order to enhance the latter's powers to serve his bidding. Empath did not exhibit the same aggression as Sublime's other hosts.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Here Comes Tomorrow===\nIn the [[Here Comes Tomorrow]] storyline (Earth-15104), it was revealed in flashbacks that after Jean's death and Xorn's apparent death that [[Professor X]] left the Xavier Institute to rebuild the island of Genosha, and a broken [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] declined Emma's offer to jointly run the Xavier Institute. [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] became the new Headmaster and faced many troubles in his attempt to teach new generations of mutants and to fight for the Dream. The stress resulted in Hank consuming Kick and, subsequently, becoming the new host for Sublime. In this new host body, Sublime waged a war against mutantkind and the X-Men, destroying the Xavier Institute in the process.<ref>''New X-Men'' #151</ref>\n\n150 years after Jean's death, Sublime was still making war, and Earth was filled with new species that were fighting for an ecological niche in the world including ''homo sapiens superior'' and ''homo sapiens sapiens'' (which was on the verge of extinction). Sublime longed to wipe out all other species, thus bringing evolution to halt, and replace it with the stagnation of his own mass-produced minions, including the Crawlers, genetic constructs made from the DNA of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and empowered with the genetic codes of [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. Sublime was aided by his champion, Apollyon, the last of the U-Men and the result of the separation of Fantomex from his bio-mechanical symbiotic ship, E.V.A.<ref>''New X-Men'' #152</ref>\n\nSublime stole the Phoenix Egg, in which a merged Phoenix/Jean Grey creature awaited her resurrection in order to bring \"the judgement of the Phoenix\". After emerging from the egg, the partially amnesiac Jean/Phoenix became a minion of the Sublime (who she believed was the Beast), exterminating the race of sentient termites dominating the \"Panafrikan Basin\"  (killing the Xavier Institute ambassador, the mutant Bumbleboy in the process) and later attacking the mutant population of \"Megamerica\" on his orders.<ref>''New X-Men'' #153</ref>\n\nSoon after, Sublime managed to duplicate Jean's DNA and obtained her Phoenix-level telekinetic powers. The nearly all-powerful Sublime fought and defeated each one of the X-Men, who were actually buying time (with their lives) in a plan to restore Jean to her senses, which she did after being confronted by Wolverine, who informed her of everything that happened since her death, including the fact that \"Magneto killed [her] on orders he never understood\".<ref name=\"xmen154\"/>\n\nHer memories regained, Jean Grey was now ready to convey the judgment of the Phoenix, to \"Burn away what doesn't work\", and purged Sublime from the Beast's body, destroying the bacteria once and for all. As it turned out, \"what doesn't work\" according to the Phoenix is what doesn't evolve, such as Sublime, which posed a threat to evolution itself.<ref name=\"xmen154\"/>\n\nSublime's host, the Beast, was then beheaded by Apollyon, who did not realize that his former master was no longer inhabiting the Beast's body, and considered himself betrayed when Sublime refused to give him the power of the Phoenix.<ref name=\"xmen154\"/>\n\nJean then transcended into the [[M'Kraan Crystal]], and from there into the mysterious White Hot Room, the higher plane of existence where other hosts of the Phoenix converge and psychically reached backwards in time to encourage Cyclops to \"live\", to accept Emma Frost's love and thus remain at the Institute; as a result, the original timeline that led to Sublime's possession of the Beast has been negated.<ref name=\"xmen154\"/>\n\n===Days of Future Now===\nIn another future timeline, seen in the ''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' miniseries (Earth-5700), [[Malcolm Colcord]], Sublime, and Weapon Plus waged war with Wolverine for years, until Wolverine found the means to go back in time and stop the whole timeline from occurring, by preventing his destruction of Colcord's face. Unfortunately, Sublime followed Wolverine back in time by possessing him in the future, and in the past, Sublime made Wolverine ravage Colcord's face once more, and when Logan rejected Sublime, he found his host body for the first time. This occurrence marks the beginning of the bacteria possessing the original John Sublime (a normal human scientist of the Weapon Plus Program), which then begins his ascendance to become the leader of the program, thus converging to the 616 timeline.<ref>Weapon X Days of Future Now #1</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Sublime appears in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]'' voiced by [[Troy Baker]] in the English Dub. This version is a white-haired human with a mechanical eye that is associated with the U-Men. He and the U-Men member Kick were abducting mutants in order to harvest their organs. After the X-Men had killed Kick, Sublime later ambushes them in the mountains while piloting a robotic armor that can use the X-Men's powers against them. Beast manages to find the robotic armor's weak point, allowing the others to defeat him. They discover that he has a mutant detection device before Sublime self-destructs himself.\n\n===Video games===\n* John Sublime appears in the video game ''[[X-Men: Destiny]]'' voiced by Joel Spence. John Sublime is shown to be associated with the U-Men. He transforms into a gigantic monster after injecting himself with a serum of concentrated \"X-Genes\" that grants him mutant powers. Sublime presumably dies in the ensuing fight.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/sublime/29-11330/ Sublime] at Comic Vine\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Sublime_%28Earth-616%29 Sublime] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Weapon Plus}}\n{{X-Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sublime (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Grant Morrison]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2001]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional cult leaders]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Fictional medicines and drugs]]\n[[Category:Fictional parasites]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
