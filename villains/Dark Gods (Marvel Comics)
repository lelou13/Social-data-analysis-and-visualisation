The characters first appear as a group in [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] #4 (Oct. 1998) and were created by [[Dan Jurgens]] and [[John Romita Jr]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe first of the Dark Gods, [[Perrikus]] debuted in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' vol. 2, #1 (July 1998), and the majority of the group featured in ''Thor'' #4 - 5 (Oct. - Nov. 1998) until an extended storyline in ''Thor'' #7 - 12 (Jan. - June 1999). The characters returned to Marvel continuity in ''Thor'' #42 - 43 (Dec. 2001 - Jan. 2002) and #53 (Oct. 2002).\n\n==Character biography==\nThe first Dark God, Perrikus, appears when accidentally freed from a prison in [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] by the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Not knowing what has occurred, Thor departs and Perrikus brings his brethren to Asgard. The core group are Perrikus (god of \"Power Unlimited and Energy Infinite\"); Majeston Zelia (the leader and Perrikus' mother); Adva (god of Portals and Knowledge); D'Chel (god of Illusion); Tokkots (god of Rhyme) and Slototh (god of Filth). With an army they invade and overrun Asgard, capturing [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], Thor's father and the ruler of the [[Norse paganism|Norse]] gods.\n\nRevealed to be the evil opposites of the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods, the Dark Gods first invaded Asgard over a millennium ago after an Asgardian scout called Lonkarr found and investigated the city of the Dark Gods. While there, Lonkarr was attacked by Tserron - the wife of Perrikus - whom he killed in combat. Perrikus then led the Dark Gods after Lonkarr to Asgard where the two factions entered into a full-scale war. Although thwarted, the Dark Gods now seek revenge. The now-adult Thor battles Perrikus and during combat slices the Thunder God's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] in half with his own weapon. Despite this setback, Thor regroups, and with the aid of fellow immortal [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the Asgardian [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] defeats Perrikus and the Dark Gods.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #1 (July 1998); #4 - 5 (Oct. - Nov. 1998); #7 - 12 (Jan. - June 1999)</ref>\n\n[[Desak]] the God Slayer eventually finds and slaughters the surviving Dark Gods, and only Perrikus and Adva (god of Portals and Knowledge) escape.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #42 - 43 (Dec. 2001 - Jan. 2002)</ref> The pair eventually battle Thor at the direction of [[Zarrko]] the Tomorrow Man, although both concede defeat when Thor severs Perrikus's right arm with the [[Bloodaxe]].
