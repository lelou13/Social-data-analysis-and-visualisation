Dormammu engages Strange in mystic combat and shows himself to be far more powerful, but, when drawing upon the realms energies, inadvertently weakens the barrier containing the horde of [[Mindless Ones]]. Since they threatened Dormammu\'s subjects, Strange helped his enemy to re-seal the juggernauts by letting power from his amulet flow into Dormammu.
