She ultimately defeats him, becoming Limbo\'s new ruler - and S\'ym\'s master - before returning to the X-Men. S\'ym challenges Illyana\'s newfound status as Limbo\'s ruler.

He plans on using the [[Man-Thing|Nexus of All Realities]] to invade Earth, but is stopped by his former master Belasco, who manipulates [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] into confronting S\'ym. Belasco reasserts his control over both S\'ym and Limbo. The two are later defeated by [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] as his girlfriend, [[Amanda Sefton]], takes over Limbo. S\'ym turns to an alliance with the Archenemy, a powerful magical entity, and disguises himself as Duke Bleys, becoming one of Sefton\'s most trusted advisers. As Bleys, S\'ym tricks Sefton into allying herself with many other demon lords and merging their various realms and dimensions into a single bastion against the Archenemy. S\'ym then reveals his true identity and reveals that the single, united realm is an easier target for the Archenemy than the countless dimensions he was fighting before.
