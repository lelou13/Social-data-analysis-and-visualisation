She is the daughter of [[Kraven the Hunter]], the niece of [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], the sister of [[Grim Hunter]], and the half-sister of [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]].\n\n==Publication history==\nAna Kravinoff first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #565. She was created by [[Marc Guggenheim]], [[Joe Kelly (writer)|Joe Kelly]], [[Mike McKone]], and [[Phil Jimenez]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAnastasia \"Ana\" Tatiana Kravinoff is a 12 year old girl who is the first female to take on the name of [[Kraven the Hunter]]. She first appears tracks Spider-Man to his apartment, but mistakenly believes Peter Parker's roommate [[Vin Gonzales]] was him. She then methodically ruins Vin's life, and captures him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #565</ref> Despite Vin's claims that he was not Spider-Man, Kraven prepared to hunt him, but was stopped by the real Spider-Man who was wearing Daredevil's costume (which notably had eyelids for him to be able to see). At the end, it is revealed that she is Kraven's daughter by a woman called Sasha Aleksandra Nikolaevich (also mother of the deceased [[Grim Hunter|Vladimir Kravinoff]]). She and her mother have recently set about forming an alliance of Spider-Man villains to get revenge on the wall-crawler and kidnap [[Madame Web]]. They also hired [[Deadpool]] to keep him distracted while they kidnapped [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]]. Their revenge scheme will play an important role in the [[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|Gauntlet]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #611</ref> Ana and Sasha later meet up with Alyosha Kravinoff who assists them in preparing for the \"Grim Hunt\" where they start going after Kaine.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #631</ref>\n\nAna assists her half-brother [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]] into attempting to abduct [[Julia Carpenter|Arachne]], only to run afoul of Spider-Man who repels them. Ana alongside Alyosha, [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], and [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]] were present when Sasha sacrificed Mattie Franklin as part of a revival ritual that resurrected Vladimir Kravinoff as a humanoid [[lion]] creature.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #634</ref> Ana alongside Vladimir and Alyosha attacked [[Anya Corazon]], only to end up fighting Spider-Man, Arachne, [[Kaine]], and [[Ezekiel (comics)|Ezekiel]] (who was really Ana's half-uncle [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] in disguise). The Kravinoffs managed to overpower them and make off with Anya and Arachne. After Chameleon sheds his disguise and Spider-Man partially succumbs to the drugs the Kravinoffs have given him, Ana was present when Kaine (dressed as Spider-Man) was killed as a sacrifice as part of a ritual that revived her father Sergei Kravinoff.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635</ref> Following the resurrection, Sergei gets acquainted with his family. When Kraven returns after preventing Vladimir from attacking the captives, he is shown to lack a sense of control attacking Ana until he is stabbed in the heart by Ana in self-defense. Sergei recovers stating that Sasha restored him with corrupted blood or the \"unlife\" as he puts it.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #636</ref> When the Kravinoff Family was defeated, Ana alongside the other Kravinoffs escaped to the [[Savage Land]]. After Sasha and Vladimir are killed by Kraven and Alyosha flees, she runs off to hunt Alyosha to prove herself to Kraven. She tells Kraven that if she can take down Alyosha, Kraven should train her and help rebuild the Kravinoff family. Otherwise, he will forget about family.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #637</ref>\n\nAna later attacks the Anya Corazon (who is now operating as Spider-Girl) in an attempt to finish the hunt she started during The Grim Hunt. Although obviously the stronger fighter, Ana is eventually defeated thanks to Spider-Girl's experience at fighting in New York City. She is thereafter incarcerated.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' vol. 2 #4-5</ref>\n\nAna later escapes incarceration and heads to Houston to hunt Kaine (the current Scarlet Spider). Ana and her brother Aloysha delivered the killing blows to Kaine that lead to his blood resurrecting her father Kraven the Hunter. However, since Kaine himself was resurrected shortly afterwards so that there could be balance between Hunters and Spiders, it remains to be seen what other motives Ana has for Kaine as there are visions of a dark future ahead for the Scarlet Spider.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\nWith the help of Ana, Kraven kidnapped Kaine's friends in order to motivate the Scarlet Spider fight him. In the end, Kaine delivered Kraven a fatal blow in the chest, which paralyzed his heart. But using the same attack, Kaine brought him back to life supposedly still breaking the curse. Following the fight, both Kravens disappeared.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2 #23</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAna Kravinoff possesses some of her father's superhuman strength and speed. She is also an expert martial artist where she is the master of Krav Maga. Ana also has expert tracking abilities. Ana has a brilliant mind and often deploys elaborate traps to surprise her foes.\n\nWhen it comes to weapons, Ana uses a variety of weapons like swords, axes, staffs, clubs, batons, whips, and spears. For ranged weapons, Ana has great accuracy when using a variety of ranged weapons like guns, bow and arrows, crossbows, sniper rifles, blow darts, bolas, throwing spears, throwing nets, and boomerangs where she rarely misses her target when using them.\n\nAna possesses a good knowledge of medicine as well as that of exotic poisons, drugs, plants, tranquilizers, and their effects on both human and animal anatomy.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Anastasia_Kravinoff_%28Earth-616%29 Kraven the Hunter (Ana Kravinoff)] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/ana-kravinoff/4005-61343/ Kraven the Hunter (Ana Kravinoff)] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Spider-Man}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional hunters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2008]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]"}]}}}}
