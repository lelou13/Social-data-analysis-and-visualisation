He began his career as a soldier in the United States Army. However, after that, not even Maddicks recalls much about his own past for some reason. When he was selected to be a special agent of the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]], Maddicks became a mercenary and professional criminal, more specifically a special agent in covert operations. He was sent to the Mutagenics Laboratory of the Brand Corporation, where he underwent extensive conditioning which increased his human abilities. He also underwent surgery which implanted a miniature anti-gravity generator in his spine. Roxxon later gave Maddicks his super-villain costume and the codename \"Killer Shrike\".\n\nFor his first mission, Roxxon sent him to infiltrate the subversive organization called the [[Conspiracy (comics)|Conspiracy]], which Roxxon learned about through major purchases of technology from the Brand Corporation. The Conspiracy sent Killer Shrike to capture a monster known as Goram. Unfortunately for Killer Shrike, the plan was thwarted by the super-hero known as [[Ulysses Bloodstone]] who short-circuited the villain's electrical weapons, badly injuring him. Feeling sorry for Killer Shrike's condition, Bloodstone's agents sent the villain to a New York hospital, where he lay comatose for several weeks.<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #1-2</ref>\n\nUpon awakening from the coma, Maddicks was contacted once again by Brand scientists, led by Dr. Stephen Weems. Weems, better known as the villain [[Modular Man]], sought revenge against his enemies [[Spider-Man]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. In return, the Modular Man promised Shrike information about his past.<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #4-5</ref> In battle with Spider-Man and the Beast, Weems was killed before he could uphold his end of the bargain.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #90</ref> Shrike escaped and was soon contacted by agents of the Brand Corporation. They helped restore his memory, and assigned him to undercover work as bodyguard to Brand president James Melvin. His costume became controlled by the [[Will O' The Wisp (comics)|Will-o'-the-Wisp]], and he was forced to abduct Dr. Marla Madison to reconstitute the immaterial Wisp. In the end, he was defeated by [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #57</ref> With Brand's public dissolution, Killer Shrike became a free agent.\n\nWith other superhuman adventurers and criminals, Killer Shrike was later captured and imprisoned by the [[Locksmith (comics)|Locksmith]]. He was freed by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50</ref> He later robbed a bank, but was defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #102</ref> He then attempted a theft of a power booster from the [[Tinkerer]] after commissioning him to build it for him, but was again defeated both by Spider-Man and a failsafe function the Tinkerer installs in his products to deal with such situations.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #310</ref>\n\nDuring the events of the \"[[Acts of Vengeance]]\", Killer Shrike attacked [[Moon Knight]], alongside the second [[Ringer (comics)#Keith Kraft|Ringer]] and [[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]]. He shot down the [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Moon Knight's Helicopter|Mooncopter]], seriously injuring Moon Knight's pilot Frenchie and then escaped.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 3 #10</ref> Killer Shrike was later hired by Surge, and battled the [[She-Hulk]] alongside [[Grey Gargoyle]] and [[Dragon Man]] but was defeated.<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #27</ref> \n\nEver since, Killer Shrike was most often seen getting beaten up by several super-heroes, most often the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Killer Shrike was briefly a member of the Cardinal's team of flying super villains known as Air Force. Killer Shrike was oddly absent when the team was blackmailed by [[Night Thrasher]] into providing relief for Rwandan refugees. In ''New Warriors'' #54 Killer Shrike appears to have been murdered by the Soldiers of Misfortune. This was probably an art error as Oriole not Killer Shrike was with the team when blackmailed by Night Thrasher.\n\nIn the [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] miniseries, Killer Shrike's powers got updated by the Tinkerer. Unfortunately, this still was not enough for Maddicks to gain a victory, as he was soon afterward defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and apprehended by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].\n\nKiller Shrike was later apprehended by [[Baron Zemo]] and forced to join the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], for so far unclear reasons.\n\nKiller Shrike later made a cameo at the Bar With No Name.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #589</ref>\n\nKiller Shrike was beat up by Moon Knight and attacked in the hospital by the [[Black Spectre#Black Spectre (Carson Knowles)|Black Spectre]].{{Issue|date=December 2009}}\n\nKiller Shrike later appeared as a member of the [[Shadow Council]]'s [[Masters of Evil]]. Killer Shrike is present when Max Fury and the Masters of Evil capture [[John Steele (comics)|John Steele]] after he attempts to escape Bagalia with the Serpent Crown and the Crown of Thorns.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #29</ref>\n\n===Killer Shrike II===\nAfter Killer Shrike sold his original costume to [[Roderick Kingsley]], Kingsley sold the costume to an unnamed criminal. Killer Shrike was present with [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] (who was actually Roderick Kingsley's butler Claude) when he led his forces into battle against the Goblin King's Goblin Underground. After Hobgoblin was killed by Goblin King, Killer Shrike was among the villains that defected to the Goblin Underground.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' #26</ref>\n\nFollowing Spider-Man's victory over the Goblin King, Killer Shrike was seen with the former Hobgoblin henchmen at the Bar with No Name where they encounter [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #1</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Killer Shrike was among the supervillains that Missile Mate assembled to join the side of [[Phil Urich]] (who was operating as Goblin King) and the remnants of the Goblin Underground upon claiming that Roderick Kingsley \"abandoned\" them.<ref>''AXIS: Hobgoblin'' #2</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nExtensive conditioning and surgery by Brand Corporation scientists enhanced Simon Maddicks's strength and other physical abilities. He is capable of flight by means of a surgically implanted anti-gravity generator at the base of his spine, activated by a neural link. Besides that, he has extensive training and experience in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts, and proficiency with hand weapons including guns and knives. Killer Shrike wears body armor, an armored suit made of an insulated steel alloy mesh capable of protecting him from flight turbulence and small caliber weapons fire. His major weapons system is the twin power-blasters worn on his wrists, with titanium talons capable of slashing flesh, wood, cinderblock, and light metals, and of discharging high-frequency electrical bolts.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Killer Shrike made a cameo in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #72, trying to rob [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]] Industries of their supply of [[Adamantium]] - but was apprehended by Spider-Man. This version was a deranged, desperate man who seemed to almost [[froth]] at the mouth; Spider-Man himself referred to him as 'Steroid-Boy with a Laser Tag Fetish'. It was later revealed that he was an employee of the Ultimate [[Tinkerer]] hired specifically to bother Donald Roxxon as vengeance for firing him.<ref>''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #72</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Killer Shrike appears in the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode \"Secrets and Lies\" voiced by [[Ty Olsson]]. In this version, he appears as an enforcer for the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] with his anti-gravity generator on his wrist-blasters. Along with [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]], he kidnaps [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], [[Pepper Potts]], and [[Mandarin (comics)|Gene Khan]] in order to send a message from [[Count Nefaria]] to Shin Zhang (Khan's stepfather) and the rival Tong organization. However, Rhodey brings the Iron Man armor to Tony to escape. At the end of the episode, he and Unicorn are held captive and tortured by Gene as the Mandarin. The Mandarin later returned Unicorn and Killer Shrike to the Maggia in the episode \"Pepper, Interrupted\". Killer Shrike (alongside Unicorn) next appeared in the episode \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\" where they break into a Tong vault using explosives supplied by [[Fixer (comics)|Mr. Fix]]. However, the bombs were designed to annihilate the entire city, not the vault. A battle ensued between Killer Shrike, Unicorn, the Tong, the Mandarin, and [[Happy Hogan]] (who was wearing the Iron Man suit at the time). Killer Shrike and Unicorn eventually fled the battle, rather than risk death by explosion. Killer Shrike and Unicorn appear again in the season 2 episode \"The Invincible Iron Man Part 1: Disassembled\" with some other members of the Maggia near the end of a heist but [[War Machine]] shows up and defeated them, leaving them for the police. In the episode \"Hostile Takeover,\" Killer Shrike assists [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]] and [[Justin Hammer]] in his Titanium Man armor to do a sneak attack on Iron Man which ended with Iron Man putting his armor on lockdown enough for Titanium Man to fly Iron Man to Hammer Multinational. Killer Shrike and Unicorn are present as Mr. Fix 2.0 tries to \"dissect Iron Man.\" Killer Shrike and Unicorn then get into a fight which recharges Iron Man until Justin Hammer breaks up the fight. Killer Shrike was defeated by Pepper Potts remote-controlling the Stealth Armor. In the episode \"The Hammer Falls,\" Killer Shrike and Unicorn are planning of leaving town and are attacked by Justin Hammer in his Titanium Man armor when Justin suspects them of blackmailing him. Iron Man pursues Killer Shrike where Killer Shrike wants to get away and tries to threaten Iron Man to kill him. Iron Man then uses the reflective angle to knock off Killer Shrike. Iron Man interrogates Killer Shrike telling him that Titanium Man must be the one that took out Blizzard and Whiplash 3.0, and Unicorn is in critical condition. Sasha later mentions to Justin that [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]] is planning to represent him in court. Justin Hammer in his Titanium Man armor intercepts the prison transport to prevent Killer Shrike from revealing Justin Hammer's illegal activities. When Titanium Man has both Killer Shrike and War Machine at laser-point, Iron Man is forced to choose who to spare. Titanium Man manages to capture Killer Shrike and ends up subjecting Killer Shrike to the Zombie Gas. Iron Man knocks out Killer Shrike upon his and War Machine's arrival.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Killer_Shrike Killer Shrike] at Marvel.com\n\n{{Hulk}}\n{{Iron Man}}\n{{Ultimate Spider-Man}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by John Buscema]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Virginia]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Fictional soldiers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Marvel characters]]"}]}}}}
