He is the King of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]], the biological father of Thor's stepbrother and archenemy, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #112 (Jan. [[1965 in comics|1965]]), and was based on the frost giantess [[Laufey|of the same name]] who, in [[Norse mythology]] was actually the mother of Loki. \n\n==Publication history==\nLaufey was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #112 (Jan. 1965).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nIn the early days of the universe, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], the King of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], marched his forces into Jotunheim to battle Laufey and the Frost Giants.<ref name=\"jim112\">''Journey into Mystery'' #112 (Jan. 1965)</ref> At the time, Odin was wielding the mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]].<ref name=\"thorv280\">''Thor'' vol. 2, #80 (Aug. 2004)</ref> Odin faced down Laufey and destroyed his war club, prompting Laufey to brandish a sword. Laufey tried to use his knowledge of land, such as trying to stop Odin with a concealed fire pit. A sprawling battle between the two forces ensued.<ref name=\"jim112\"/> The battle ended with Odin using Mjolnir to crush Laufey's skull.<ref name=\"thorv280\"/> Odin discovered a baby that was Laufey's son [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] amongst the wreckage of the castle and made the decision to raise him as his own. Laufey had kept Loki hidden as he was ashamed that Loki had been born a [[runt]].<ref name=\"jim112\"/>\n\nIt was later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] that Loki had been a child, rather than a baby, when Laufey was killed. The day prior to the battle, Loki had attempted to inform him of an opportunity to stealthily kill Odin prior to the battle. Laufey struck Loki for calling him a coward.<ref name=\"jms12\">''Thor'' vol. 3, #12 (Jan. 2009)</ref> The next day, after the fateful battle and Odin's claiming of Loki as a son, Laufey was left wounded, but alive. A version of Loki from the future, who had traveled back in time to alter events, proceeded to decapitate him, stating that Laufey would never strike him again. He also made Odin adopt him.<ref name=\"jms12\"/>\n\nThe remains of Laufey, specifically his skull, play an important role in the first three issues of the renewed Thor series. Laufey's revitalized men attempt to reclaim his remains from a Midgardian scientific facility. <ref>\"Thor\" #1-3 (2014)</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{Thor family tree}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike all Frost Giants, Laufey is immortal and possesses superhuman strength and resistance to physical injury and Earthly illness, as well as a weakness to heat. As a Frost Giant, Laufey is unharmed by cold temperatures, making him immune to [[hypothermia]] and [[frostbite]].\n\nLaufey is cryokinetic and has been seen wielding many weapons, including a giant [[Club (weapon)|war club]],<ref name=\"jim112\"/> a [[sword]],<ref name=\"jim112\"/> and a large [[axe]].<ref name=\"jms12\"/>\n\n==In other media==\n===Film and television===\n* Laufey appears in the [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' played by [[Colm Feore]].<ref name=\"feoreaudio\">{{cite news|url=http://collider.com/colm-feore-interview-thor-on-set-interview/64245/|title=Colm Feore On Set Interview THOR; The King of the Frost Giants Reveals All!|first=Steve | last=Weintraub|publisher=Collider|date=2010-12-10|accessdate=2011-03-14}}</ref> As in the comics, he is Loki's father although he is unaware of the connection. Loki gives him access to Asgard, but later betrays and kills him before he can kill Odin in the Odinsleep.\n\n* Laufey appears in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode \"Hulks on Ice\", voiced by [[Enn Reitel]]. He leads the Frost Giants in a plot to take over the Nine Worlds. Upon confronting Laufey, the Hulks and Thor end up subdued by the cold winds and captured. Laufey arrives revealing his plot and even commented that he doesn't know what Thor sees in the humans. She-Hulk breaks free from the ice and frees Thor and the Hulks as Laufey gets away. After defeating the three-headed Ice Serpent, the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and Thor arrive at Laufey's lair as Laufey unleashes his ice creatures on them. Following the plug-up of the ice, Laufey states that they have helped to free [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]] who will help bring an endless winter to Earth. Thor engages Laufey in battle while the others work to fight Ymir's weak spot. Laufey states that as Earth grows cold, his power increases. After Red Hulk's heat had helped to defeat Ymir, Laufey retreats back to Jotunheim. In the episode \"Into the Negative Zone,\" it is revealed that [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] tipped off Laufey on where he could find Ymir.\n\n===Video games and toys===\n* Laufey appears in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'' voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. In a bonus mission at Jotunheim, Laufey collaborates with [[Malekith the Accursed]] where they capture Heimdall and trap him in an icy prison causing Thor and Loki to come to his rescue. Unlike Malekith the Accursed, Laufey does not engage Thor and Loki in battle.\n\n* A figure of Laufey was released in the ''Marvel [[Minimates]]'' line, in the single-pack army builder wave based on the film ''Thor''.\n\n* A figure of Laufey will be released in [[Hasbro]]'s 3.75\" ''[[Thor: The Mighty Avenger (toy line)|Thor: The Mighty Avenger]]'' movie tie-in line.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Comics|United States}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Laufey_%28Earth-616%29 Laufey] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Thor}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1965]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional kings]]\n[[Category:Fictional giants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics giants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Thor (Marvel Comics)]]"}]}}}}
