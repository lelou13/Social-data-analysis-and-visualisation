Skurge fell in love with the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] and was frequently used in schemes by her and the trickster god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].  He was a long-time antagonist of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and other heroes of the Marvel universe and was a member of the original [[Masters of Evil]].  Eventually, he joined the heroes of Asgard in a mission to [[Hel (location)|Hel]], where he sacrificed his axe to destroy [[Naglfar]], the ship of the dead, and delay [[Ragnar\\u00f6k|Ragnarok]], and sacrificed his life to hold the bridge at Gjallerbru so the heroes could escape the forces of Hel.   After a time trapped in Hel, he joined the honored dead in [[Valhalla]].  \\n\\nThe name was later used by two other characters, an axe-wielding android member of the [[Crazy Gang (comics)|Crazy Gang]] and a vigilante named \'\'\'Daniel DuBois\'\'\', the son of [[Princess Python]].\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nThe Executioner first appeared in \'\'[[Journey into Mystery]]\'\' #103 (April, 1964), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n\\n===Skurge===\\n\\nSkurge was born in [[J\\u00f6tunheimr|Jotunheim]], and later became a warrior, gaining the name Executioner after fighting in a war against the Storm giants. Skurge has always had feelings for Amora, the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], and regularly aids her in various evil schemes to gain control of Asgard. However, the Enchantress only manipulates him, using her charms to keep Skurge under her thrall. [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], the trickster god, also has used Skurge many times.\\n\\nIn his first appearance, the Executioner teams with the Enchantress to battle [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] at the behest of Loki. He exiles [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] to another dimension and tries to get Thor to surrender his hammer to him in exchange for bringing her back. Thor agrees to this, but when the Enchantress turns Skurge to a tree for bringing Foster back he releases Thor from this bargain, whereupon Thor returns the two to Asgard.<ref>\'\'Journey into Mystery\'\' #103</ref> The Executioner and the Enchantress are exiled to Earth by [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], where they learn of Zemo from a newspaper. They became members of [[Baron Zemo#Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]]\'s original [[Masters of Evil]] to defeat the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The Executioner disguises himself as a former aid of Zemo, and lures [[Captain America]] to Zemo\'s kingdom, while the Enchantress uses her powers to turn Thor against the Avengers. Later the Executioner helps Zemo to escape Captain America by knocking Cap out.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #7</ref> Skurge functioned as part of Baron Zemo\'s Masters of Evil for some time. Again and again he would battle the Avengers. The Masters of Evil created [[Wonder Man]], who was meant to trick and destroy the Avengers. When the Executioner was defeated by Wonder Man testing his power, he worried about controlling him, though Zemo revealed Wonder Man would die within a week unless given an antidote. The gloating Skurge was derided by Wonder Man, who did not like the need for trickery and deceit. The group\'s plan to kill the Avengers was soon thwarted by Wonder Man, and Skurge and his allies were defeated.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #9</ref>\\n\\nThe Executioner menaced [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], and fought [[Balder (comics)|Balder]] as any ally of Loki.<ref>\'\'Journey Into Mystery\'\' #116-117</ref> He was later among the legion of villains assembled by [[Doctor Doom]] to destroy the [[Fantastic Four]] using a mind-control machine, but due to Mister Fantastic the villains all had their memory of this event erased.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four Annual\'\' #3</ref>\\n\\nApart from the Enchantress, Skurge attempted to establish an empire by the conquest of an alternate future 25th Century Earth. He battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] after he was accidentally transported there.<ref>\'\'Tales to Astonish\'\' #76-77</ref>\\n\\nHe was reunited with the Enchantress, and joined the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]\'s attempted world conquest with four other villains after being taken to his base by teleportation technology. He attacked the Asian sub-continent with an army of trolls due to the valuable diamonds that were there, and fought [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] in another dimension he had transported them to with his axe, but was beaten and thrown at a giant the Enchantress had created to defeat the [[Scarlet Witch]], destroying it.<ref>\'\'Avengers Annual\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\nHe next led a Troll invasion of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref>\'\'Hulk\'\' #102</ref> Odin banished him to the realm of Casiolena.  Skurge abandoned the Enchantress to become Casiolena\'s co-ruler.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #83</ref> He led Casiolena\'s forces against the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], and resumed his alliance with [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|the Enchantress]].<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\nSkurge attacked Dr. Strange alongside Enchantress, but they were defeated.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He later battled the Defenders and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] as the Enchantress\'s ally.<ref>\'\'Marvel Two-in-One\'\' #; \'\'Defenders\'\' #20</ref>\\n\\nSkurge led an assault on Asgard, and fought Balder again.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #258-261</ref> With the Enchantress, he serves as Loki\'s lieutenant during his brief rule of Asgard.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #263-264</ref> With the Enchantress, he joined with the forces of Asgard against the legions of  the most powerful fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #350</ref>\\n\\nOnce Amora the Enchantress set her sights on [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]] as a potential lover, Skurge sought to ease the wounds of his heart in battle, joining [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], and the [[Einherjar]] on a rescue mission into [[Hel (location)|Hel]]. A group of souls belonging to living humans had been trapped there by [[Malekith the Accursed]], and [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]] had refused to permit them to return to [[Midgard]] (Earth).<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #360</ref>\\n\\nDespite initial misgivings, Thor permitted Skurge to accompany the group. He soon vanishes after Amora appears to him, saying that Heimdall had slain her. This was not Amora, but [[Mordonna]], a shape-shifting sorceress in the employ of Hela. This disguise was only broken when Skurge managed to trust Balder more than the desires of his own heart. Hela whisks Mordonna away before Skurge could gain revenge.\\n\\n[[Naglfar]], the ship of the dead, was nearing ready to sail, and Hela promised Skurge a place of honor beside her on it at the battle of [[Ragnarok]]. In a rage at being manipulated, Skurge destroyed the ship with the sacrifice of his axe, forestalling the end of days. The group was pursued out of Hel, and at the bridge Gjallerbru Thor swore to hold the bridge as long as he could that the souls of the mortals could reach freedom. But then Skurge struck down Thor from behind, and amidst cries of traitor begged Balder to hear him speak. Hoping to enact vengeance upon those who mocked him, and to do what was right in the end, he would stay behind. He asked Balder to promise that Thor and he would drink to the memory of Skurge. Balder consented to Skurge\'s wish, and he, the Einherjar and the mortal souls departed Hel, taking the unconscious Thor with them.\\n\\nSkurge remained alone at Gjallerbru, armed with M-16 rifles the Einherjar had brought from Earth for the expedition. Though the armies of Hel marched upon the bridge, none crossed past where Skurge stood. As he fought down demon after demon, his stand impressed Hela herself, who would later sometimes tell of Skurge; \\"He stood alone at Gjallerbru. And that answer is enough.\\" He was eventually overrun and killed by Hela\'s forces.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #362</ref>\\n\\nFollowing his death, he remained in Hel for a time until Thor - currently cursed by Hela so that his bones would become brittle and never heal while simultaneously being unable to die of his injuries - assumed control of the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]]. Thor attacked Hela\'s domain, pretending to have fallen under the Destroyer\'s influence until Hela restored his body to full health, hoping she could kill him that way. Skurge attempted to use diplomacy to reach Thor\'s spirit inside the armor, for he knew the destruction of Hel\'s realm would mean all realms would crumble. Thor dropped him with one blow. He later gains his body as intended. Although Skurge was unable to stop the Destroyer\'s rampage, he guessed that Thor was truly in control when the Destroyer spared his life rather than killing him. Thor asks Skurge if there is anything he could do, for attacking him with that blow as part of his bluff against Hela. Skurge informed Thor that he asked for nothing more than for Thor and Balder to drink to his name as they had promised (something they hadn\'t yet managed to do due to time being against them). Recognizing that Skurge\'s honor and courage belonged somewhere better, Hela allowed him to depart her realm and released him to Valhalla. Thor and Balder are said to have many drinks to Skurge\'s name.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #382</ref> \\n\\nWhile there, his spirit was summoned from Valhalla by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] as a member of his [[Legion of the Unliving]], and he battled Thor.<ref>\'\'Avengers Annual\'\' #16</ref> His spirit was freed from Hela\'s prison when he led the other escaped Einherjar to join an assault on Hela\'s forces by the Asgardians and [[New Mutants]].<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' #85</ref> He earned for himself a place in [[Valhalla]], Asgard\'s place for honored dead. After his death, the Enchantress realized that she truly possessed feelings for Skurge and mourned his demise.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} The time-travelling villain [[Tomorrow Man|Zarkko the Tomorrow Man]] once pulled him and eight other villains out of the Timestream to battle the Thor Corps, but he was defeated.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #439-441</ref>\\n\\nOnce, Amora gave the Executioner\'s axe to a mortal man called Brute Benhurst. Thor, believing him Skurge (this second Executioner wore a mask), tried not to fight him until the Executioner hit Kevin Masterson (son of [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson]]). Thor recognized hitting a boy as an ignoble thing which Skurge would never do, and defeated the new Executioner.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\\n\\n[[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] later recruits Skurge to aid [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson]] in fighting off the influence of the [[Bloodaxe (comics)|Bloodaxe]], the former weapon that Skurge wielded.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\\n\\nEnchantress attempts to attack [[Yggdrasil]] in order to free Executioner from Valhalla. Doing so threatens all reality. She is stopped by Thor, Loki, and Balder, who convince her that her actions are dishonoring Skurge\'s memory.<ref>\'\'Thor: God-Sized Special\'\' #1 (2008)</ref>\\n\\n===Crazy Gang===\\nThe Executioner is a silent [[Android (robot)|android]] swathed in a long robe and hood and armed with an axe. It follows the commands of the Red Queen and seems to lack any real intelligence. It was destroyed under unknown circumstances,{{issue|date=November 2013}} but it had been destroyed and repaired before.{{issue|date=November 2013}}\\n\\n===Young Masters===\\nA character named \'\'\'The Executioner\'\'\' (Daniel DuBois) appears in \'\'[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: [[Young Avengers]]\'\'. He is described as \\"a rich and organized urban vigilante who hunts and kills criminal scum. And likes to hurt pets.\\"<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19890 NYCC: Cornell Talks \\u201cDark Reign: Young Avengers\\u201d], [[Comic Book Resources]], February 7, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/020920-Brooks-Young-Masters.html Mark Brooks: Designing the Young Masters], [[Newsarama]], February 20, 2009</ref> It is later revealed that this Executioner is the son of [[Princess Python]],<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Young Avengers\'\' #2</ref> and knows [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]] from school, and is aware of her secret identity, knowledge that he uses to try and blackmail his way onto the team.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Young Avengers\'\' #3</ref>\\n\\nExecutioner isn\'t aware of his mother\'s identity as Princess Python, at least until it\'s actually pointed out to him. However, it may be that he was simply in denial about this matter, as [[Norman Osborn]] comments that if \'\'his\'\' mother was Princess Python, then he\'d like to think he\'d know and Kate Bishop immediately realizes who she is upon meeting her.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Young Avengers\'\' #3</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nSkurge possessed the [[superhuman]] abilities of a typical male Asgardian. Due to his unique hybrid physiology, with a half Frost-Giant and half Skornheimian [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]], Skurge\'s physical strength, stamina and durability were considerably greater than those of the average Asgardian male.  He also possessed superhuman visual acuity. Skurge was extremely long-lived, aging at a much slower pace than human beings, though not truly [[Immortality|immortal]]. His body was highly resistant to physical damage, and he was immune to terrestrial diseases, toxins, and some magic. In the event of injury, Skurge\'s godly [[Energy (esotericism)|lifeforce]] would allow him to recover with a superhuman rate. Skurge had proficiency at hand to hand combat, and mastery of most Asgardian weapons. He would often fight wielding his large, enchanted, double-bladed battle axe that allowed him a number of abilities including cutting rifts into other dimensions and control over fire and ice that he could project at his enemies. Skurge also sometimes wore an enchanted impregnable horned helmet that completely covered his head. In his first appearance Skurge demonstrated a \'super-human falcon hunting vision\', that enabled him to find Jane Foster in a crowd.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\\n\\nThe Second Executioner is a vigilante with no super powers.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\nAnother \'\'\'Executioner\'\'\' was a member of [[Mad Jim Jaspers]]\' [[Crazy Gang (Marvel Comics)|Crazy Gang]]. He carries and wields a large pole axe.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\\n\\n[[Captain Britain]] was sent to an alternate Earth, known as Earth-238, by [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlyn]]. Together with [[Saturnyne]], he hoped to save this world from the corruption that threatened it. Instead, they encountered Earth-238\'s [[Mad Jim Jaspers]], a lunatic with the ability to warp reality. Serving Jaspers were the Crazy Gang which included Executioner. This group of superhumans were based on characters from [[Lewis Carroll]]\'s \'\'[[Through the Looking-Glass]]\'\'. Captain Britain and Saturnyne individually managed to escape this Earth and Jaspers and the Crazy Gang, including Executioner, were killed when Earth-238 was destroyed by Saturnyne\'s successor, Mandragon.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\\n\\n===\'\'[[JLA/Avengers]]\'\'===\\nExecutioner is among the villains enthralled by [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] to defend his stronghold.{{Issue|date=December 2011}}\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Television===\\n* Executioner appears in The Mighty Thor portion of \'\'[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]\'\'.\\n* Executioner appears in \'\'[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]\'\', voiced by [[Travis Willingham]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm Comics Continuum]</ref> Due to the child-friendly status of the show, he is referred to only as \\"Skurge\\".
