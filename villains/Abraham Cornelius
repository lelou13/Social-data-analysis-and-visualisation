He was first mentioned in [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]\'s eight page preview prequel chapter to the original \\"[[Weapon X|Weapon X Saga]]\\" in \'\'Marvel Comics Presents\'\' #72 but first appeared in \'\'Marvel Comics Presents\'\' #73 (March 1991).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nDr. Cornelius, one of the senior scientists for Weapon X, is employed by the mysterious [[Professor Thorton|Professor Andre Thorton]] and partnered with a young Dr. Carol Hines. Some time after World War II, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is taken in by the project and Cornelius is assigned with the task of perfecting and using a technique that would bond the indestructible alloy [[adamantium]] to human bone cells. This adamantium-bonding process was first created by [[Lord Dark Wind]] ([[Lady Deathstrike]]\'s father), but is only put into use after being perfected by Cornelius when he succeeds in bonding Logan\'s skeleton with adamantium, after which Logan is indoctrinated into the Weapon X assassin program.<ref>\'\'Marvel Comics Presents\'\' #72-82</ref>\\n\\nYears later, Japanese crime lord Matsu\'o Tsurayaba and his allies, including former Weapon X scientist Doctor Cornelius, resurrect the Russian super-soldier [[Omega Red]]. In order to stabilize his mutant power, Omega Red requires the Carbonadium Synthesizer, a device stolen from him by Team X decades earlier. Omega Red captures Wolverine, who had the location of the C-Synthesizer buried in his memory, and several of Wolverine\'s teammates in the X-Men. [[David North (comics)|Maverick]] is hired by former [[Team X]] liaison Major Arthur Barrington to prevent Omega Red from obtaining the device, and he tracks another former Team X member, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], to Omega Red\'s location. With Maverick\'s help, the X-Men are able to defeat the villains. In the final confrontation between the Hand and Wolverine, Cornelius is killed by Maverick.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #7</ref>\\n\\nNow, as Wolverine faces his death, Abraham Cornelius has returned. He seems to have near unlimited amounts of money, is killing and collecting different marvel characters that have adamantium, and has put a price on Logan\'s head so high that it\'s prompted nearly every assassin and mercenary to attack Wolverine.  <ref>\'\'Death of Wolverine\'\' #3</ref>\\n{{-}}\\n\\n==Ultimate Marvel==\\nIn the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Doctor Cornelius plays a much larger role than his mainstream counterpart. He first appeared in the [[Ultimate X-Men]] story arc \'\'Return to Weapon-X\'\'. <ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #7-12</ref>\\n\\nIn this version, Doctor Cornelius along with his benefactor, Colonel [[John Wraith]] heads up the Weapon X Program. Unlike his benefactor though, he does not seem to harbor any anti-mutant sentiments, but he merely wishes to conduct experiments on mutants to indulge his own curiosities. The Weapon X Program is sanctioned by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] during the [[Gulf War]] and results with the creation of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], their greatest achievement ever. After Wolverine escapes, Weapon X captures several other mutants to be his replacements and eventually captures the X-Men as well. In their captivity, Cornelius augments the [[Beast (comics)#Ultimate Beast|Beast]]\'s natural abilities along with giving him a keen sense of smell. This procedure causes Beast to transform even more by growing blue fur all over his body and growing claws on his hands and feet. After Wraith is killed by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] and Weapon X is shut down by S.H.I.E.L.D., Cornelius\' whereabouts are unknown. It is not confirmed if he has anything to do with the rogue Weapon X agents led by Tara who hunt Wolverine all over Manhattan and participate with the coup against the President of the United States.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #7-12</ref>\\n\\nLater on, he recruits the [[quadriplegic]] [[Lady Deathstrike]] and offers her a chance of revenge against [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], the person who is responsible for her present condition. He splices some of Wolverine\'s DNA with hers which gives her a healing factor that is twice as fast as Wolverine\'s and also bonds her shattered body with adamantium. Cornelius\' true objective however is to capture Wolverine since he is accompanied by Storm at that time and he uses that fact to manipulate Deathstrike. His attempts, however, end in failure with Deathstrike being captured and imprisoned in the [[Triskelion]] and his chopper being blown up. He is presumed dead. <ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #58-60</ref>\\n\\nIt was revealed that he survived the helicopter crash but has been horribly disfigured. He is responsible for [[Sabretooth (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Sabretooth]]\'s latest attack on Wolverine in order to gain a tissue sample. The attack works and Corenelius is shown planning to use the flesh to clone a more a compliant Wolverine.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #89</ref>\\n\\nApart from the scarring, the Ultimate Marvel version Doctor Cornelius resembles Professor Thorton (the original Director of the Weapon X project in the mainstream universe).\\n\\nIn \'\'[[Ultimate Origins]]\'\', it is revealed that Cornelius\'s experiments on Wolverine created the mutant gene, which he claims is how humanity will survive.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Origin\'\' #1</ref><ref>\'\'Ultimate Origins\'\' #5</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Abraham Cornelius appears as a voice in several episodes of \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men (1992 Series)]]\'\': first in the season 2 episode \\"Repo Man\\" and later in the season 3 two-part premiere \\"Out of the Past,\\" which reuses footage from \\"Repo Man.\\"\\n\\n* Abraham Cornelius first appears in the \'\'[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]\'\' episode \\"Past Descretions\\" voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]].
