The character made a posthumous appearance in ''The New Warriors Annual'' #1 (1991) and 2 (1992).\n\nCatseye appeared as part of the \"Hellions\" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #5.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n'''Sharon Smith''' was a member of the original [[Hellions]] recruited by [[Emma Frost]] to be a competitive team to the [[New Mutants]] and a tool for the [[Hellfire Club]]. Her character was the antithesis of [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] who could transform into a wolf. She engaged in several battles with the New Mutants\u2014mostly petty competition\u2014but occasionally got along with the students, sometimes having dances to socialize. Her personality was that of a free spirit. Catseye's youth and comparative lack of sophistication belie a ferocious intelligence. She had a photographic memory and instinctively knew when she was being lied to. Under Frost's tutelage, Smith progressed from total illiteracy to upper grade school reading levels in less than a year.<ref>''New Mutants'' #31</ref> She still retained several feline qualities while in human form, having been forced to provide for herself since earliest infancy. Notably, she kept her tail in many instances. Upon her first meeting with Wolfsbane, rather than attack out of an animalistic nature, she smelled Rahne and said that as shapechangers the two of them shared a kindred spirit and that they should be friends \u2014 this in spite of the obviously played feline/canine feuding roles.<ref>''New Mutants'' #17</ref>\n\nEmma Frost takes advantage of the New Mutants' emotional turmoil after an incident where a cosmic being called the [[Beyonder]] had actually killed them and then brought them back to life. She persuades the current headmaster of the school, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], to send the students to the Massachusetts Academy for psychic counseling. There, she  promptly accepts them into the ranks of her Hellions. Catseye shares a room with Rahne, and the two of them become close friends. The two teams become quite fond of one another but were separated when Magneto realized that his mind had been manipulated by [[Empath (comics)|Empath]] and the decision to release the students had not been fully his.<ref>''New Mutants'' #38-40</ref>\n\nCatseye and Wolfsbane later meet at a formal dress party sponsored by the Hellfire Club. The two sneak off, leave their dresses behind and romp in their animal forms.<ref>''New Mutants'' #53</ref>\n\nLater, the two teams clash high above Manhattan. Both had learned about the existence of [[Bird-Brain]], and neither team wanted the other to have him. The Hellions lose the encounter. Furthermore, an accident sends Catseye and [[Roulette (Marvel Comics)|Roulette]] plunging to the streets. Roulette's power saves them both, allowing them to land safely in a store canopy.<ref>''New Mutants'' #56</ref>\n\nThe White Queen later causes a confrontation between her team and the [[New Warriors]] over the fate of [[Firestar]], a member of the Warriors who used to be a part of the Hellions. The battle, held in the New Warrior's penthouse, comes down to a game of numbers, and Catseye scored one for her team by viciously defeating [[Night Thrasher]], easily tearing through his reinforced armor. Ultimately, the Hellions lost by attrition, though nobody defeated Catseye in turn.<ref>''New Warriors'' #9-10 (March\u2013April 1991)</ref>\n\nSoon after, Emma threw another party which the Hellions as well as the [[X-Men]] Gold team attended. It was there that [[Trevor Fitzroy]]\u2014a member of the villainous group known as the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]]\u2014crashed the party with the goal of killing Emma in order to gain points within the group. Some of the Hellions died in the initial firefight. The rest, including Catseye, were killed in order to fuel Fitzroy's [[Teleportation|teleportation portal]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281 (1991)</ref>\n\n===Post Death Illusions===\nCatseye makes a [[postmortem]] appearance in the 1997 Annual of ''Generation X''. However, this was just a trick played by the [[demon]] [[D'Spayre]] to agitate Emma Frost.<ref>''Generation X Annual'' (1997)</ref>\n\nAlso in the ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #55-56, the Generation X members become trapped in an illusion by [[Adrienne Frost]] where each of them is a different Hellions member except for [[Jetstream (comics)|Jetstream]]. The afflicted heroes relive the Hellion's last day. Jubilee was Catseye.<ref>''Generation X'' #55-56</ref>\n\n===Necrosha===\nCatseye, along with all the other deceased Hellions is resurrected by Selene and Eli Bard. After breaking into Utopia with the help of Cypher, she and the other Hellions confront Emma Frost and taunt her for not saving them. She is subdued by Cyclops when she goes to attack Emma.<ref>''X-Necrosha'' #1 (October 2009)</ref> Part of her return was also portrayed in two issues of the then-current ''New Mutants'' series.<ref>''New Mutants'' #8-9 (2009)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCatseye's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] power is [[Ailuranthrope|ailuranthropy]], the ability to become a cat. She can transform into either a [[housecat]] or a human-[[cougar|panther]] hybrid (a [[werecat]]). In her panther form, she has superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance in addition to hyper-keen senses, razor-sharp claws and fangs, a [[prehensile tail]], a slight [[healing factor]], and the ability to crawl up walls.\n\nEven in her human form, she retained some catlike physical features such as slitted pupils and a tail.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nCatseye was still alive in the alternate reality called the [[Age of Apocalypse]] and was a Hellion. She and the others were hunted down and apprehended by the X-Men, after being knocked out by an enraged Wolfsbane while attempting to flee the beat-down of her fellow Hellions.<ref>''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse'' # 1</ref>\n\n===What If===\nIn a reality where the second X-Men team disbands, Catseye is recruited to fill the ranks.<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' Vol. 2 #60</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/catseye Uncannyxmen.net Character Profile on Catseye]\n*[http://uncannyxmen.net/groups/hellions-i Uncannyxmen.net feature on the Hellions]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Fictional werecats]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
