Together with the Storm Giant '''Skagg''', the character invades Earth, although the pair are met by Odin, his son the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and fellow Asgardian [[Balder (comics)|Balder]]. Odin stops time and sends every human on Earth to another dimension. Surtur sends Thor into the ocean with a fireball of his. Skagg is saved from sinking into the ocean by Surtur hardening the ground, but is defeated by Odin, who is weakened by the feat. Surtur creates a blazing fireball and travels to the [[North Pole]] to melt the icecaps. Using Odin's sword, Thor stops Surtur and traps him on a meteorite of magnetic particles in another galaxy.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #104 (May 1964)</ref>\n\nIn the title ''Thor'' the seer [[Volla (Marvel Comics)|Volla]] predicts that Loki will free Surtur and other enemies of Asgard and eventually bring about [[Ragnarok]] - a war that will end with the destruction of all the Norse Gods.<ref>''Thor'' #128 (May 1966)</ref> The character features in the title ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' when summoned - together with ice giant [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]] - to Earth by the cult the [[Sons of Satannish]].

Here Odin and the demon battle to the death, being reborn each day to repeat the cycle, preventing either from being reborn. Thor helps Odin beat Surtur twice, even though he will be reborn, before returning to his body. Thor offers to help Odin escape from this realm and the constant battle with Surtur. Odin chooses to remain in order to protect his people from the demon.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #7 - 8 (Mar. - April 2008)</ref>\n\nSurtur was resurrected and made a deal with Loki and a group of beings known as the Manchester Gods, who he manipulated to depose the native gods of the British isles.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #641</ref> He then set the world tree Yggdrasil on fire and attempted to turn the Vanir gods against the Aesir in preparation for his assault on Asgard.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #19</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSurtur was depicted as an immense and malevolent elemental fire demon whose power was of apocalyptic proportions. Standing over 1,000&nbsp;ft. in height, Surtur possessed strength and durability by far surpassing that of Thor; the ability to generate intense heat, flames or concussive force; molecular manipulation such as transforming his fingers into serpents;<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #99</ref> levitation and inter-dimensional travel. Surtur's scale of power is usually shown to equal that of Odin. He is a skilled warrior and swordsman, and has a prehensile tail. He possesses a great intellect, and has vast knowledge of ancient and arcane wisdom. He is vulnerable to intense cold, and can be imprisoned by certain magical spells or by other beings wielding cosmic energy powers equaling his own.\n\nSurtur possesses the giant sword Twilight, also known as the Sword of Doom, composed of a metal known as Scabrite which can only be found in the mines of Sutur's realm. The sword is magical, capable of manipulating vast amounts of mystical energy, such as shattering dimensional barriers and inhibiting Odin's powers. Loki has temporarily tapped into the power of the sword to change Thor into a frog (Thor is normally resistant to this type of magical transformation) and making the Asgardian populace sick (Asgardians are normally immune to disease). Morgan Le Fay tapped into the power of the sword to reshape the entire planet Earth from modern day into a medieval world after using the chaos magic of the Scarlet Witch to \"bridge the gap\" between her personal faerie powers and the Asgardian magics bound to the blade. When the sword is bonded with the Eternal Flame, its powers are further increased to an unknown level.\n\nThe Eternal Flame has an unknown connection to Surtur. When in its vicinity, Surtur claimed it increased his powers. It is unknown to what extent this power increase leads to.\n\n==Other versions==\nSurtur appears in an [[Amalgam Comics]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] publication ''Thorion of the New Gods'', in which he assaults Asgard during [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], but is stopped and imprisoned by the [[DC Comics]] [[Source (comics)|Source]] on the Ego-Mass\u2014an amalgamation of [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]] and the [[Source Wall]].<ref>''Thorion of the New Asgods'' (June 1997)</ref>\n\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] reality, Surtur is seen summoned to Earth by Loki and battling the [[Ultimates]]. However he is not seen in the final battle with the Ultimates. <ref>''Ultimates'' vol. 2, #13 (May 2007)</ref>\n\nIn the series ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Surtur is part of [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s army, and attacks [[Wonder Woman]] near the end of the issue after she vows to guard a pass so the other heroes can get through, although [[She-Hulk]] stays to help her.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Surtur appears in the ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' episode \"The Vengeance of Loki\".

Wasserman]] (reprising his role from ''Thor: God of Thunder''). In the episode \"Acts of Vengeance\", [[Baron Zemo]] uses the Norn Stone associated with Muspelheim to protect himself against [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] which ended up freeing Surtur from his imprisonment. The seal breaking was sensed by Thor, Odin, and Balder. Surtur attacks the realm of the Dwarves due to the Dwarf King Eitri holding fragments of the Twilight Sword. At the end of the episode, Enchantress awakens in Surtur's presence telling her that she now works for him. In the episode \"The Ballad of Beta Ray Bill\", Surtur sends a possessed Enchantress to unleash Fire Demons upon different areas with one of them being the Korbinite's planet. After Thor and Beta Ray Bill defeat Enchantress, Surtur speaks through her stating that Enchantress is no longer in their control before teleporting her away. Surtur is then seen reforging the Twilight Sword from the fragments that he had collected from Eitri.\n\n* Surtur appears in ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]''. In the episode \"Nighthawk,\" Thor is sent through Surtur's realm through a Norn Stone when Nighthawk activated the contingency plan against Thor. After being freed from the contingency plan by Hulk, Thor mentioned that he flew through Surtur's realm 81 times. In the episode \"Back to the Learning Hall,\" Thor, Hulk, and Hawkeye are transported to Surtur's realm. They are extracted out of Surtur's realm by Heimdall's portal at the last minute.\n\n===Film===\n* In ''[[Thor: Tales of Asgard]]'', Surtur's sword \"'''Elderstahl'''\" is the focal part of the story. Surtur is seen in flashbacks in Jotunheim battling Odin over the fate of the Nine Realms.\n\n* In the Marvel animated feature ''[[Hulk Vs|Hulk Vs Thor]]'' segment, Surtur makes a brief cameo at the start of the film as one of the enemies attacking Asgard during the Odinsleep.\n\n===Video games===\n* Surtur has a cameo appearance in the future part of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.
