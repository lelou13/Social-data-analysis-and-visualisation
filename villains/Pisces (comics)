The Zodiac Cartel was founded by [[Taurus (comics)|Cornelius van Lunt]] (Taurus), handpicking the eleven other members; van Lunt concealed his own identity, while he was the only one who knew the identities of the others. Each member was based in a different American city as part of his nationwide criminal network, with the ultimate goal of world economic and political domination.\n\nThe Zodiac was infiltrated by Nick Fury, posing as Scorpio; the Zodiac fought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and escaped.<ref>''Avengers'' #72</ref> Led by Taurus, the Zodiac later attempted to kill all Manhattan residents born under the sign of Gemini as a show of power, but were thwarted by the Avengers. Taurus's faction attempted to kill the Zodiac dissident faction, but all twelve leaders were captured by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #120-122</ref> A new android version of the Zodiac later appeared, led by Scorpio in a new android body, massacred the human Zodiac, and took over their criminal operations.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #26 (November 1987)</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===Life Model Decoy Pisces===\nA second Pisces was a [[Life Model Decoy]] created by [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio (Jacob Fury)]] in his \"Theatre Of Genetics\" to be part of his Zodiac crime organization. Scorpio planned to use the LMD's to serve as members of his own Zodiac organization. The [[Capricorn (comics)|Capricorn]] and Pisces androids, however, died due to imperfections soon after their activation.<ref>''Defenders'' #48-50</ref>\n\n===Third Pisces===\nAfter the \"death\" of the first Pisces LMD, Scorpio created a second version of the Pisces LMD. This version of Pisces, along with the other members of the Zodiac LMD's, joined under [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] during his bout with temporary insanity to battle the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for their imagined wrongdoings.<ref>''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #1</ref>\n\nPisces joined Aquarius, Capricorn and [[Sagittarius (comics)|Sagittarius]] at the \"Ant-Hill\", an abandoned Sentinel factory. Pisces ended up facing off against [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and was destroyed when Thor crushed it beneath a giant piece of machinery.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Female Pisces===\nAfter the destruction of both previous male versions of Pisces, Scorpio created a female Pisces. She arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]]. Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. In their initial foray, the Avengers failed, although several androids were destroyed.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #26-28</ref>\n\nThe Zodiac Key immediately resurrected the Scorpio LMD. Claiming superiority and believing that the Zodiac would eventually kill the Avengers as the androids could never be stopped, Scorpio wanted to use the Key to transport everyone on the scene to the Key's native dimension where the conflict, he believed, could be prolonged indefinitely. However, when the androids were in the other dimension, they ceased to function because each of them were aligned with a particular zodiacal energy, energy that did not exist in the other dimension. The Avengers found [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Tigra]] had been sent to the same dimension and, reunited, the team was sent back to Earth by the Brotherhood. However, secretly the Brotherhood waited so that someday they could also send the Key to Earth again and create new conflicts for them.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Ecliptic Pisces===\nPisces was one of the first members of the Zodiac. Pisces was confident and a calming influence on some of the more headstrong Zodiac members. Her calling Guardian \u2018mammal\u2019 suggests she was something other than human. Pisces was the lover of Sagittarius. She was killed with the rest of the Zodiac by [[Weapon X]].\n\n===Thanos' Pisces===\nThe sixth Pisces is an unnamed male that [[Thanos]] recruited to join his incarnation of the Zodiac.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nPisces is a skilled underwater combatant and wore a special outfit specifically designed for underwater combat.\n\nThe first android Pisces has a set of gills that allow her to breathe underwater. In its second form, Pisces possessed super-strength and durability. In its third form, Pisces fins, gills, and scales to assist in underwater combat and an ability to produce a watery mist from its body. She exhibits a personality based on the Pisces sign and claims to have prophetic dreams.\n\nEcliptic's Pisces possesses the ability to transform into water and is always in her watery form. She can surround her enemies with water and fire a blast of water. She also can alter the appearance of her human form and possesses the Zodiac teleportation device.\n\nThe sixth Pisces wears a special suit that enables him to assume a [[fish]]-like appearance.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Pisces (alongside the other Zodiac members) appears in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]''. Pisces is depicted as a female fish-like alien.\n* Pisces appears in the ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: Iron Man]]'' episode \"Technical Difficulties.\" It is depicted as a computer virus (designed with a blue shark-like motif) which is operated by a boy named '''Sho''' (voiced by [[Kenichi Suzumura]] in the Japanese version and by [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] in the English Dub) after he was approached by [[Ho Yinsen]] to use the Pisces Virus on Zodiac's behalf to take down the \"evils\" of Tony Stark. Pisces attacks and controls all electronic hardware in Tokyo. Iron Man takes the Pisces Virus into his armor to fight the Pisces Virus from within.
