Horgan had what was described as \"feline agility\". The Organizer was secretly Abner Jonas, a candidate for mayor of New York City, who sent the Ani-Men on missions to undermine the current administration. Daredevil defeated them and the Ani-Men and Organizer all went to prison.<ref>''Iron Man'' #10-11</ref> Later, Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man formed a team called the \"Unholy Three\" with the [[Death-Stalker|Exterminator]], and fought Daredevil again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #39-41</ref> The Unholy Three, as a team of independent thieves, fought Daredevil and [[Spider-Man]] and were defeated.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #25</ref>\n\nApe-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man later rejoined the Ani-Men, and the Ani-Men went to work for [[Count Nefaria]]. Nefaria's scientists submitted the unwitting Ani-Men to processes that gave them superhuman powers and animal-like forms. The Ani-Men invaded the Cheyenne Mountain missile base for Count Nefaria, and fought the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' #94-95</ref>\n\nThe Ani-Men lost their superhuman powers and reverted to normal. Count Nefaria sent the four original Ani-Men to kill [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], however the [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] detonated a bomb with which he had intended to kill Stark, and the resulting explosion killed the Ani-Men instead.<ref>''Iron Man'' #115-116</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===Sebastian Patane===\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--> \n|image=\n|caption=\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080 \n|character_name=Cat-Man\n|real_name= Sebastian Patane\n|species=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #157 (Mar 1979)\n|creators=[[Roger McKenzie (comics)|Roger McKenzie]], [[Mary Jo Duffy]], and [[Gene Colan]]\n|alliances=[[Ani-Men]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=Cat-like claws<br>Extraordinary acrobatic skills\n|}}\nAfter the deaths of the original Ani-Men, the [[Death-Stalker]] recruited a new team of Ani-Men, with a new Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man. He sent the new Ani-Men to capture [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]].

He was an athletic man with considerable agility and reflexes, and extraordinary acrobatic skills. While employed by the Exterminator, Horgan wielded a \"time-displacement ray\" (\"T-ray\") gun that fired a ray which projected its victim into a limbo-like inter-dimensional void.  The gun could thus \"displace\" a victim for a limited period of time, such as 30 minutes. A ray blast of sufficient intensity could exile a victim to the inter-dimensional void permanently. Horgan was later subjected to an unknown mutagenic process administered by [[Count Nefaria]]'s scientists which temporarily gave him superhuman agility and razor-sharp claws that were actually part of his body.\n\nPatane possessed the same abilities as the first Cat-Man, including cat-like claws on his costume, and extraordinary acrobatic skills.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/catmanhorgan.htm|Cat-Man I}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1965]]\n[[Category:Fictional werecats]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
