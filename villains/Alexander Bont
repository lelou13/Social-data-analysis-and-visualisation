He was created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Alex Maleev]], first appearing in \'\'Daredevil\'\' vol. 2, #66 (Dec. 2004). He was [[retcon]]ned into being the Kingpin of Crime before [[Wilson Fisk]]. His story was told via flashbacks, which were drawn to resemble artwork from the [[Silver Age of comic books]]. The climax of \'\'Daredevil\'\' Vol. 2, #65 (Nov. 2004) alluded to Murdock having been Bont\'s attorney at one time. This plot thread was dropped however as it was revealed in later issues that Matt refused to be his lawyer.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n\\n===The First Kingpin===\\n[[Image:youngbont.JPG|thumb|left|A younger Alexander Bont.]]Alexander Bont first made a name for himself when he killed the hero known as the Defender.<ref name=\\"Daredevil vol. 2, #67\\">Daredevil vol. 2, #67</ref> After that, he soon rose up the ranks and became the head of organized crime.\\n\\nThe Fixer, the man who ordered the hit on Jack Murdock, paid up to Bont. When Daredevil found this out, he confronted Bont and got him arrested.<ref name=\\"Daredevil vol. 2, #67\\"/> Bont got out on bail. He later asked Matt Murdock for legal help, but was refused.\\n\\nWhen he got out, he paid a visit to the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]] who had worked for Bont in the past. He ordered Potter to kill Daredevil. \\"I made my rep on the blood of one masked mystery man...I\'m not--I am \'\'not\'\' going to lose it over another one.\\"\\n\\nThe Gladiator attacked Daredevil, but was defeated. Daredevil found out that Bont had hired him, and told Bont that he\'d see him in jail for this.\\n\\nBont was found guilty and sent to prison. The last thing he saw before being loaded into the bus was Daredevil perched on top of a nearby building, smirking at him.\\n\\n===Bont\'s Revenge===\\nWhen Bont was released from jail, he was now a bitter old man. He had found out that Daredevil was really Matt Murdock from \'\'The Globe\'\' and had acquired a possession of [[Mutant Growth Hormone (comics)|Mutant Growth Hormone]].<ref>Daredevil vol. 2, #69</ref>\\n\\nThe world had changed a lot in his absence. Places had changed and his beloved wife died while he was imprisoned. Furious, Bont set out to get revenge on Daredevil.\\n\\nHe met up with Melvin Potter again, who refused to work with him. Bont threatened him with the death of his daughter. \\"I\'ve arranged for the murder of your four-year-old daughter. She\'s never \'\'met\'\' you, but she\'ll die \'\'because\'\' of you. \'\'You\'\' do what \'\'I\'\' say.\\"\\n\\nPotter kidnapped Matt Murdock, and was forced to beat him while Bont videotaped it. He then dragged Matt out (in his Daredevil costume) to show the public. When the new [[White Tiger (Angela Del Toro)|White Tiger]] arrived on the scene and defeated Melvin Potter, Bont took some MGH and threw Matt into a window, savagely beating him and telling him that this was where his father was killed.\\n\\nHowever, the action, coupled with the overdose of MGH, proved to be too much for Bont. His heart exploded, killing him.<ref>Daredevil vol. 2, #70</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Film===\\n\\nThe character of Alexander Bont is briefly featured in the film \\"Punisher \'79-82\\" from [[Blinky Productions]].
