This Glowworm was William Blake, a former soldier who had volunteered for experiments to re-create the [[Captain America|Super-Soldier Serum]]. After leaving the Marine Corps, one night he transformed into a huge, glowing white creature who began screaming racial slurs and attacking black people in [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]\'s neighborhood. When news got out that a \\"white mutant\\" was attacking blacks, it nearly sparked a race [[riot]], but once Cage defeated the creature, it reverted to human form, revealing that he was a black man himself.{{issue|date=August 2013}} Blake had grown up in the [[Deep South]], at a time when rampant racism led him to believe that blacks were inferior to whites, resulting in his own hatred of himself and his own race.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/glowwormblake.htm]</ref>\\n\\nIt has been revealed that Glowworm has remained in custody since his initial capture.<ref>Avengers: Most Wanted Files.</ref>\\n{{-}}\\n\\n===Glowworm===\\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\\nimage=\\n|caption\\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\\n|character_name=Glowworm\\n|real_name=\\n|species=[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Human Mutant]]\\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\\n|debut=\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1#7 (August 1986)\\n|creators=[[Louise Simonson|Louise Jones ]]<br>[[Jackson Guise]]\\n|alliance_color=background:#cccccc\\n|alliances=[[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]\\n|aliases=\\n|powers=Generate and release spheres of destructive energy \\n|}}\\nThe second Glowworm first appeared in \'\'[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]\'\' #7 (August, 1986). This Glowworm is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with a humanoid torso, and a worm-like tail instead of legs. He is the partner of Bulk, a mutant with enormous size and strength.\\n\\nBulk and Glowworm were outcasts, not just for their mutant status or unusual appearance, but because both continually gave off toxic levels of hard [[radiation]]. The two sought shelter in a [[toxic waste]] dump in New Jersey, but upon hearing about the group X-Factor (who at that time were posing as mutant hunters), the pair decided to attack them to \\"protect mutants\\". After a short battle, the members of X-Factor explained their true nature as mutants themselves. The two returned to their isolation.{{issue|date=August 2013}}\\n\\nIn \'\'[[New Mutants]] Annual\'\' #4, Bulk and Glowworm seemingly sacrificed their lives to save [[Danielle Moonstar]].<ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/blkglwm.htm|Glow Worm}}</ref>\\n{{-}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n\\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
