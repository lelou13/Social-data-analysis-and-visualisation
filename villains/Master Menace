He usually wears a suit of [[powered armor]] with an arsenal of built-in weapons, which enables him to fight [[superhuman]]s on a more equal basis (especially his nemesis, [[Hyperion (Marvel Comics)|Hyperion]]).\n\n===Publication history===\nMaster Menace first appeared in ''Thor'' (vol. 1) #280 (February 1979), and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Wayne Boring]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''Squadron Supreme'' #6-8 (February\u2013April 1986), #10-12 (June\u2013August 1986), ''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (1989), and ''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (September 1998).\n\nMaster Menace received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #5.\n\n===Fictional character biography===\nOriginally, Hyperion encountered Dr. Emil Burbank (a.k.a. Master Menace) on [[Earth-712]] (sometimes called \"Earth-S\"). In his first appearance, he battled Hyperion while the hero was filming a movie directed by Burbank's brother, L.L. Burbank.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nBurbank claimed that exposure to Hyperion's \"flash vision\" caused his hair to grow wildly (whether this is true or not remains speculative); the origin of his enmity pastiches the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] Luthor, who blamed Superman for his baldness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nOn this occasion, Burbank worked with the evil Hyperion of the mainstream Marvel Universe, and held captive the visiting [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Burbank was taken captive but later found himself in an interdimensional vacuum as he attempted to escape confinement.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nIt is unclear what happened to Burbank between his capture by Thor and the time the extradimensional [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] took control of President Kyle Richmond (a.k.a. [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]]) of Earth-712, home of the [[Squadron Supreme]] and through Richmond that Earth's United States of America. While the Squadron concentrated on rebuilding America, Master Menace (as he now called himself) concentrated his efforts on conquering the Middle East. He gave shelter to three of Nighthawk's enemies: [[Remnant (comics)|Remnant]], [[Pinball (comics)|Pinball]], and the [[Mink (comics)|Mink]]. He sent the Mink, Remnant and Pinball to [[Earth-616]]. Master Menace pulled Hyperion through the interdimensional gulf and revealed his true origins. He supplied the [[America Redeemers|Redeemers]] with a way to reverse the brainwashing technology of the Squadron.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn '''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe''', Emil Burbank aged fifteen years after going into the 41st century with Scarlet Centurion to build a device to stop the [[Nth Man]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn '''Squadron Supreme: New World Order''', Emil Burbank is a wheelchair-using old man, at the mercy of large, multi-national corporations and using the Squadron's own Utopia technologies.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Supreme Power==\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image =<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:emilsqsup001.jpg|225px]] -->\n|caption=Supreme Power<BR>Art by [[Gary Frank]]\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\n|character_name= Emil Burbank\n|real_name=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] \n|debut=[[Supreme Power]] #18\n|creators=[[J.

In DC's [[Post-Crisis]] continuity, Luthor was a young genius who arranged the death of his parents in a car crash and began his empire using the life insurance policy that he took out on their lives.  In DC's Pre-Crisis continuity, Luthor had a sister named Lena, and in the Superman novels written by [[Elliot S! Maggin]],  used multiple identities.  Emil Burbank's origin is a combination of both interpretations of Lex Luthor.\n\n===Fictional character biography===\n'''Emil Burbank''' is a man with many aliases and possibly the greatest intellect on the planet. He has [[Doctoral]] Degrees in [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Metallurgy]], [[Psychology]], [[Economics]] and [[literature]] from three different universities. As a child, he sexually abused his older sister by drugging her unconscious with chemical compounds, eventually leaving her in a permanent catatonic state. At 18, his parents died in a car accident, which he arranged and boasts about even while trying to say it was an accident. Emil is noted for malicious and homicidal retribution against those he feels have wronged him. A school bully and a professor who accused him of cheating were both caught in fires started by Emil.\n\nAfter Emil agrees to work for the government, General Alexander sends Emil, [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]], [[Arcanna]], and [[Shape (comics)|Shape]] to apprehend or destroy Hyperion. While fighting Hyperion, Arcanna's quantum powers, Nuke's radioactive blast, and Hyperion's flash vision combine to create an effect that sends them all to an alternate reality, where Hyperion and most of the other heroes wage war against Earth's governments, to \"save\" humanity. However, the \"alternate\" reality is actually the same reality, only years in the future. Emil and Hyperion are the only two members of the Squadron aware of this information after the five are returned to the correct time stream.<ref>''Supreme Power:Hyperion'' #1 - 5 (2005 - 2006)</ref>\n\nEmil was to be on the [[covert operations]] team after Hyperion's return to America, but after Mark informs reporter Jason Scott of the project and gives him a list of the super-humans working for the government, the U.S. President gives a press conference and announces the formation of Squadron Supreme.\n\nThe team is sent to [[Uganda]] to apprehend John M'Butu, a fast-rising tribal leader gifted with a powerful verbal suggestion ability, who calls himself '''the Voice'''. Burbank reveals that he has developed counter measures to defend himself from everyone on his team, except for [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]] and [[Doctor Spectrum]]. Before [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] attacks him, he defeats her with a powder he designed to kill her by suffocation.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 1, #1 - 3</ref>\n\nOn a mission codenamed \"Long Walk\", to take down insurgents of the Ilam Province in Iran, Emil developed technology that disrupts the functionings of the [[inner ear]], incapacitating the soldiers, who Emil then proceeded to shoot. After [[Inertia (Marvel Comics)|Edith Freiberg]] found a little girl whose mother had been stoned by relatives for the perceived dishonor of being raped, Edith, using Emil Burbank as a translator, finds the relatives and buries them up to their necks. She then gives the girl a steel bar with which to kill them. After \"Long Walk\", Emil Burbank is at the conference to act as a bodyguard.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 1, #4 - 6</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nEmil Burbank was recruited to the Squadron because he was tested by the military and found to have been exposed to the [[retrovirus]] that had been released from [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]]'s spacecraft and bestowed superhuman abilities on numerous people around the world. Even though Emil's enhanced intellect is a direct result of the retro-virus, Emil denies it, insisting that his genius is his own doing.\n\nThough not displaying any physical super powers, Emil demonstrates that he can defend himself in combat situations by the use of certain types of technology.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #4</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.classicmarvel.com/cast/master_menace.htm Marvel Heroes Classic Roleplaying Game page on Master Menace]\n*[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Master_Menace_%28Earth-712%29 Marvel.com page on Master Menace]\n\n[[Category:Characters created by J.
