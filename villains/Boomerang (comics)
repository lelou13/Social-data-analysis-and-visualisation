He has been a member of several prominent supervillain teams and clashed with several heroes throughout his career, most notably [[Spider-Man]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}\nBoomerang first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #81 (July 1966), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\nHe appeared as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'' beginning in issue #157, and remained with the team after the title transitioned into ''Dark Avengers'' beginning with issue #175 through the conclusion of the series.\n\nBoomerang features as one of the main characters in ''[[Superior Foes of Spider-Man]]''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nFred Myers was born in [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory]], [[Australia]] and was raised in the United States. As a young boy he developed a love for [[baseball]], and spent years training and perfecting his pitching arm. By the time he was a young adult, Fred had realized his dream of [[Pitcher|pitching]] for a major league team. However, he foolishly began accepting bribes, and was drummed out of the major leagues after being discovered. Shortly thereafter, Myers was contacted by the [[Secret Empire]], an international criminal organization that saw the potential of his skills. Myers agreed and was given a new costume and an arsenal of deadly [[boomerang]]s, from which he derived his new codename. He battled the Hulk after taking Betty Ross hostage to get plans, but the Hulk rescues Betty.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #81</ref>\n\nAfter the Secret Empire collapsed, Boomerang returned to his native Australia and laid low for a few years, perfecting his deadly aim and making modifications to his weapons. Once he was ready, he returned to America and began offering his services as a freelance assassin-for-hire. His first mission was to assassinate [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], though he was defeated.<ref>''Iron Fist'' #13</ref> He was next hired as part of a large group of superhuman criminals employed by [[Libra (comics)|Libra]] to battle the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #64</ref> He was hired by [[Madame Hydra|Viper]] to participate in a plot against [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and battled [[Spider-Man]], [[Nick Fury]], [[Shang-Chi]], and the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #83-85</ref> Boomerang next sought to kill Spider-Man in order to impress the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] of Crime and thus gain employment; however, he was defeated by the wall-crawler and apprehended by the police.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #67</ref> He was seen next helping the [[Punisher]] escape from prison.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #81</ref> Boomerang was eventually released from prison. He was hired by Max Stryker to coerce Bruce Banner into using an experimental cancer cure that uses gamma rays on Stryker, but wound up battling the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Banner's alter ego, instead.<ref>''Hulk'' #294-295</ref>\n\nBoomerang was then recruited by [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] into the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. As part of that team, he battled Spider-Man, [[Silver Sable]], and the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #280-281</ref> Then, he was hired by Louis Baxter III to attack a yacht, and again battled Spider-Man.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #144-145</ref> He then battled [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] at the instigation of a disguised [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #27</ref> Next, he teamed with [[Blacklash]] and [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]] II to help [[Iron Man]] battle the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #239</ref> He was then employed by [[Justin Hammer]], and battled [[Cardiac (comics)|Cardiac]] and Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #345</ref> With the Sinister Syndicate again, he participated in a crime spree. During these events, Boomerang vied with [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] for [[Leila Davis]]'s affections.<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1</ref> Boomerang was among several of the hired killers who responded to an open bounty on [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]] that was put out by [[Samuel Silke]] as part of an elaborate plan to usurp the Kingpin's empire. After defeating [[Shotgun (comics)|Shotgun]], Daredevil detects Myers on an adjacent rooftop. Boomerang in hand, Myers hesitates when he realizes Daredevil has discovered him, and then runs away. Daredevil follows him, beats him, and threatens him when he finds the picture of Matt Murdock in Myers' pocket. Myers subsequently tried to sue Murdock for $1,000,000 over the beating.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #28</ref>\n\nAround this time he also worked for the villain the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]]. He teamed up with the super-powered villain [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]]. Both created new stylish outfits for themselves, Boomerang's resembling a three-piece business suit.<ref>''Underworld'' #2</ref> This did not last long, however, and he soon returned to his old costume.\n\nBoomerang has been a member of the [[Masters of Evil]] and battled the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #24-25</ref> He has also been a member of the [[Sinister Twelve]].<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #10-11</ref>\n\nBoomerang plays a small role in the \"[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]\" crossover event.<ref>''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' #4-5</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nBoomerang is briefly shown as a captive of [[Baron Zemo]], captured before Zemo's team was given official sanction to take down villains.<ref>''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #103</ref>\n\nDespite this, he appears with [[Hydro-Man]] and [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], on the rooftop of Bailey's auction house.

When Nonstop tries to quit and escapes, the other team members chase her and capture her. When a news crew arrives, Outback attempts to frame Nonstop as a thief, but [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] reveals \"Outback\" as Boomerang and punches him out.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref> \"Outback\" is later part of the forces at Camp HAMMER that battle the Avengers Resistance when the group attacks during the events of \"Siege\". He's knocked out by Ultra Girl and Batwing.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #34</ref>\n\n===Jackpot===\nBoomerang appeared as a hired goon of the [[Rose (Marvel Comics)|Rose]] and came into conflict with [[Jackpot (comics)|Jackpot]], where he discovered her secret identity.

The Sinister Six was defeated by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Spider-Man's body) and Boomerang was nearly beaten to death until Peter Parker's consciousness restrains Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #1</ref> Boomerang was seen in the Raft's infirmary with [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] where they are enhanced by [[Alistair Smythe]]'s mini Spider-Slayers after accepting the offer to kill Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11</ref> While Scorpion goes after Mayor J.

After admitting that he may have exaggerated or outright fabricated many of the details, Boomerang asks his companion what his name is; the man responds with \"[[Spider-Man|Peter]]\".<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Steve Lieber|inker = Steve Lieber|story = Goodbye, Farewell and Good Riddance|title = The Superior Foes of Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #17|date = 26 November 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\n==Powers, abilities, and equipment==\nFred Myers has no superhuman powers, but he has the strength, speed, agility, dexterity, reflexes, coordination, and endurance of a professional athlete from his days as a baseball player. He can throw small objects with nearly unerring accuracy, and his aim is nearly the peak of what a non-superpowered human can accomplish. Only characters like [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and [[Taskmaster]] can match his accuracy.\n\nBoomerang's most dangerous asset is, naturally, his arsenal of specialized boomerangs designed by [[Justin Hammer]]. He has modified and improved on them over the years, but the most common ones are exploding \"shatterangs\" (with enough explosive power to destroy an automobile), \"gasarangs\" that release large doses of tear gas to disable a target, razor-bladed \"razorangs\", sonic blasting \"screamerangs\", and whirling \"bladarangs\" which cut like buzzsaw blades.\n\nBoomerang wears light body armor supplied by Hammer, with a wide variety of hidden pockets and pouches for his smaller, specialized boomerangs, in addition to attachments for securing the seven larger primary boomerangs. Boomerang also has jet boosters in his boots which are controlled by mental command through cybernetic circuitry in the cowl, that allow him to fly through the air at speeds up to {{convert|30|mi/h|km/h}}, and can be used as an offensive weapon when fired at close range.\n\nBoomerang has knowledge of basic street-fighting techniques.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Boomerang===\nThe Ultimate version of Boomerang appeared briefly in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #61</ref> Spider-Man saved him from being shot by the [[Punisher]] during a heist. Boomerang thanks and then offers Spider-Man thousands of dollars to save him from the police, but Spider-Man webs him up along with his would-be assassin/thief. Like the [[Shocker (comics)#Ultimate Shocker|Shocker]], his Ultimate self is a much weaker, almost parody version of himself.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #61</ref>\n\n===JLA/Avengers===\n{{main|JLA/Avengers}}\nBoomerang is among the enthralled villains defending [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold, and is defeated by [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] Flash.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Boomerang appears in the Hulk segment of ''[[The Marvel Superheroes]]''. He was hired by [[Secret Empire]] to defeat Hulk.\n\n* Boomerang appears in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'' episode \"Command Decision\" voiced by Rob Cowan. He is seen as a member of [[Baron Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil]].\n\n===Video games===\n* He also makes an appearance as the boss of the first level of ''[[The Uncanny X-Men (video game)|The Uncanny X-Men]]'' video game. The manual defines him as a mutant, with the power of accuracy with thrown objects.\n\n* Boomerang appears as a minor villain in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game.\n\n* He appears in the game ''[[Spider-Man and Captain America in Doctor Doom's Revenge]]''.\n\n* A [[Marvel Noir|Noir]] version of Boomerang appears in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].
