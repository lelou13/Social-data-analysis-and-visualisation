While working as a chemist and research scientist for Mainstream Motors, he created an \\"alchemy gun\\" capable of transmuting matter from one form to another by an unknown process (wood to glass, etc.). Horace Claymore, the company\'s president, was impressed until Curtis voiced his intent to keep the device. Claymore argued that since the gun was made on company time, it belonged to Mainstream. When Claymore fired him, Curtis adopted the persona of Chemistro to gain revenge and to extort his former employers.\\n\\nIn combat with [[Luke Cage]], Chemistro accidentally fired his alchemy gun at his own right foot, turning it to steel, though the unstable nature of the transmutation soon caused it to crumble to dust, leaving him crippled.<ref>\'\'[[Luke Cage|Luke Cage: Hero for Hire]]\'\' #12</ref> Carr was turned over to the police, and in prison was beaten by his cellmate Arch Morton into revealing the means by which the alchemy gun worked. Morton took on the Chemistro persona, and Carr invented a \\"nullifier\\" device which enabled Cage to defeat Morton.<ref name=\\"Power Man #37-39\\">\'\'Power Man\'\' #37-39</ref> \\n\\nCurtis\'s alchemy gun was later stolen by his younger brother Calvin, who became the third Chemistro. Curtis aided Cage and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] in defeating Calvin.<ref>\'\'Power Man and Iron Fist\'\' #94, 96</ref>\\n\\nLater, Curtis came to work at a division of Stark Enterprises as a research scientist and Director of Research and Development at Stark Prosthetics in Denver, Colorado. He created an artificial prosthesis to replace his missing foot. Stark Prosthetics ended up attacked by the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] during the \\"[[Acts of Vengeance]]\\" when the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] sent him to attack [[Iron Man]]. Curtis aided Iron Man and [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]] against the Wrecker and Calvin, although Calvin destroyed Curtis\' left foot.

He forced Curtis Carr to reveal the secret of his alchemy gun while they were cellmates. Upon leaving prison, Morton attempted to replicate the alchemy gun, but it exploded in his hand, granting him superhuman powers and enabling him to transmute substances via touch. He battled Luke Cage on behalf of the [[Baron (comics)|Baron]].

He is a highly skilled inventor and built his alchemy gun, which fires radiation able to transmute any substance into any other form of matter. He also built a \\"nullifier\\" rifle which is able to neutralize and reverse the effects of the alchemy gun, and Arch Morton\'s transmutation powers. The devices are cybernetically linked to the user, enabling him to work any transformation he can imagine. The transformed material usually turns to dust after exposure to heat or after a certain amount of time. Therefore his alchemy gun cannot be used merely to transmute substances, such as turning lead or rock into gold. As High-Tech, Curtis Carr employed an armored exoskeleton suit and various devices of his own invention.\\n\\nArchibald Morton was granted the ability to transmute substances by the touch of his left hand in a similar fashion after his experimental version of the alchemy gun exploded.\\n\\nThe third Chemistro, Calvin Carr, used a set of wrist-blasters designed by the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], which functioned in an identical manner as his brother\'s alchemy gun.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===[[House of M]]: [[Masters of Evil]]===\\nThe Calvin Carr version of Chemistro appears as a member of Hood\'s Masters of Evil.<ref>\'\'House of M: Masters of Evil\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* The Curtis Carr version of Chemistro appears in \'\'[[The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes]]\'\' episodes \\"The Breakout\\" Pt. 1, \\"This Hostage Earth\\", and \\"Acts of Vengeance\\", voiced by [[Nolan North]].
