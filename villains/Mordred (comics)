[[Merlin (Marvel Comics)#Merlin of Legend|Merlin]] warned Arthur that Mordred would be responsible for the end of Camelot, but before Arthur could put the baby to death, he was rescued and raised in anonymity.  Mordred was an insurrectionist, and his many conspiracies against his father were foiled by his constant foe Sir Percy of Scandia (the original [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Black Knight]]) and others until finally Mordred's forces defeated Arthur's on Salisbury Plain.{{issue|date=February 2013}}  Arthur and Mordred fatally wounded each other, and before dying, Mordred mortally wounded the Black Knight as well. Mordred was taken to Castle Scandia, where he died.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn modern times, Mordred's spirit has been allowed by the evil Celtic \"nether gods\" he serves to become active on Earth.
