He was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Paul Neary]] and first appeared in ''[[Captain America]]'' #323 (November 1986) as '''Super-Patriot'''. He was later redesigned as a new incarnation of '''Captain America''' and, just a few years later, as U.S. Agent.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character John Walker was first introduced as the supervillain Super-Patriot in ''Captain America'' #323. [[Mark Gruenwald]] created Walker to counter the general message in ''Captain America'' of [[patriotism]] being invariably good, describing him as someone\n: who embodied patriotism in a way that Captain America didn't \u2014 a patriotic ''villain''. Basically, I just wanted to do the opposite of Steve Rogers. Okay, Steve Rogers is a poor northern urban boy. So I'll make a guy from rural middle class south. Cap is now old, so this guy'll be a real young up-and-comer. Cap has lofty ideals, so I'll make Super-Patriot be more realistic and more pragmatic. So, I put together his background and character traits by playing the opposite game.<ref name=\"DAK54\"/> \nAfter a return appearance in ''Captain America'' #327, Gruenwald reintroduced him as the new Captain America in issue #333. Though Gruenwald said he would not have done this if it had not been a logical development from the preceding storylines, he also openly acknowledged that the motivating reason for replacing Steve Rogers as Captain America was to boost sales: \n:With ''[[Iron Man]]'', for example, we had [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] take the lead character's place, and we did it for two years \u2014 which I'm sure was about a year and a half longer than anybody thought we would do it. In ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' we had [[Beta Ray Bill]] take Thor's place for two or three issues. So, this is the sort of thing that has been done to shake up people before. You know, I'm responsible for it in ''Iron Man'' and I was editor of ''Thor'' at the time of Beta Ray Bill, and believe me it's a trick I know ''works'' because I've seen it work a number of times. It's just to get you noticed so that people who don't normally read it will say, \"Oh, I heard something about this, let me read it and see.\" And with luck, folks will get hooked on the storyline.<ref name=\"DAK54\">{{cite news | first = Dwight Jon | last = Zimmerman | date = January 1988 | title = Mark Gruenwald | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | pages = 5\u201323 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>\n\nJohn Walker's installation as Captain America indeed provided a major boost to the series's sales,<ref name=\"DAK54\"/> and he remained the main character of ''Captain America'' for issues 333 through 350, during which his character generally becomes more heroic. In ''Captain America'' #354 he is given another name and costume change, this time as U.S. Agent using a discarded costume of Steve Rogers (the original Captain America), a black outfit with a different alignment of the stars and stripes to differentiate it from Steve Rogers' suit.\n\nLike some [[West Coast Avengers]] teammates who had their own series (such as Iron Man, or [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] in ''[[Solo Avengers]]''), the character U.S. Agent was popular enough to earn his own [[Miniseries|limited series]] in 1993. The mini-series was used to finish off a long-standing Marvel Universe plot thread involving the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].\n\nDuring the events of the \"[[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]]\" storyline, U.S. Agent was given a new uniform reminiscent of [[Riot control|riot police]] uniforms. He continued to use that uniform in his 2001 miniseries, which followed the events in \"Maximum Security\" and was written and drawn by [[Jerry Ordway]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Origin===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}\nJohn Walker was born in the fictional town of Custer's Grove, Georgia. He grew up idolizing his older brother, Mike, a [[helicopter]] [[Aviator|pilot]] who died in the [[Vietnam War]].{{Issue|date=February 2012}} John wanted to honor his brother's memory by enlisting in the military, becoming a soldier himself.\n\nAfter John received an honorable discharge from the United States Army, he was told by a friend about the [[Power Broker]], a mysterious individual who gave people superhuman abilities.{{Issue|date=February 2012}} Walker and his friend received treatments that granted him superhuman abilities.\n\n===Super-Patriot===\n[[Image:CaptainAmerica327 front cover.jpg|thumb|John Walker as Super-Patriot. Cover of ''Captain America'' #327 (March 1987). Art by [[Mike Zeck]] and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]].]]\n\nWalker, now in debt to the Power Broker, intends to join the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]]. Ethan Thurm persuades Walker to become a hero instead. With Thurm backing him, Walker debuts as the corporate-sponsored Super-Patriot. Super-Patriot travels the country promoting his image to the nation. At a rally in [[Central Park]], he holds a secretly rehearsed performance in which he publicly criticizes Captain America and is subsequently attacked by three extremist supporters of Captain America called the Bold Urban Commandos or \"Buckies\". Walker defeats them in the staged fight as a demonstration of his combat prowess and patriotism. Captain America confronts Walker privately afterwards and demands that he stop using the Buckies, since people attending the rally could have been hurt in a panic resulting from the staged attack. Walker refuses, arguing that his actions are justified by his quest to replace the outdated Captain America as the nation's symbol.<ref>''Captain America'' #323</ref>\n\nWhen Captain America repeatedly refuses his challenges to a fight, Super-Patriot attacks him. Although Captain America proves to be a more skilled fighter and lands blow after blow, Walker manages to absorb the attacks. With neither man going down after a lengthy brawl, a weary Captain America is left questioning his own fighting abilities.<ref>''Captain America'' #327</ref> After his fight with Captain America, Walker kills a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] named Warhead who threatened to detonate a [[nuclear weapon]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=autogenerated3>''Captain America'' #332</ref>\n\nWalker is the second Super-Patriot character in the Marvel Universe. The first Super-Patriot debuted in ''[[Nick Fury]]: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #13 in July 1969 and would never appear again. The original Super-Patriot's costume bears no resemblance to that used by John Walker.\n\n===Captain America===\nSoon after, the original Captain America, Steve Rogers, abandons his costume and identity when ordered to report directly to the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]], feeling that Captain America had grown beyond the name's original role as a symbol of America during the war and not wanting to be tied down to a political agenda.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> [[Val Cooper|Dr. Valerie Cooper]], a member of the Commission, suggests that Walker should be made the new Captain America, as a U.S. government operative. Though repulsed by the notion of giving up being Super-Patriot and taking on the identity he has criticized so much, Walker ultimately answers, \"Ma'am, if [[Uncle Sam]] wanted me to be [[Mickey Mouse]], I'd do it.\" In becoming Captain America, he is forced to abandon Thrum as his manager, and can only retain one of the \"Buckies\", [[Battlestar (comics)|Lemar Hoskins]], since the other two fail to pass background checks.<ref>''Captain America'' #333</ref><!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Walkercaptain.jpg|right|thumb|Walker dons Captain America's uniform for the first time.<br>''Captain America'' #333, [[September 1987|Sept. 1987]]]] -->\n\nHoskins is partnered with Walker as the new [[Bucky]], but Hoskins later changes his codename to \"Battlestar\" due to the negative racial connotations of the name for a black man. They follow the orders of Adrian Sammish. Walker is trained by [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], the [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]], and the [[Taskmaster]] - Taskmaster's training focusing on teaching him how to use [[Captain America's shield]] - and goes on his first mission against [[The Watchdogs]], a militia group.<ref>''Captain America'' #333-335</ref>  Although he finds himself trying to emulate Rogers' ethics, Walker is more brutal than his predecessor, due to his reactionary points of view. His superhuman strength and lack of emotional control lead him to inadvertently beat [[Professor Power]] to death.<ref>''Captain America'' #338</ref>\n\nThe two rejected \"Buckies\", now calling themselves [[Left-Winger (comics)|Left-Winger]] and [[Right-Winger (comics)|Right-Winger]], crash the press conference arranged by Cooper to reveal the \"new\" Captain America and Battlestar, and announce Walker's name and birthplace on national TV.<ref>''Captain America'' #341</ref> His parents are subsequently killed by The Watchdogs; this incident drives Walker closer to a mental breakdown, particularly when the Commission orders him not to step out of line in the future, resulting in him missing his parents' funeral due to his new responsibilities. In a state of rage, he kills many of the Watchdogs,<ref>''Captain America'' #345</ref> and beats Left-Winger and Right-Winger to a pulp, leaving them to die in an explosion.<ref>''Captain America'' #347</ref> They are left terribly burned and in critical condition.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Walker is then captured by [[Flag-Smasher]], but rescued by the original Captain America, Battlestar, and [[Demolition Man (comics)|D-Man]].<ref>''Captain America'' #348-349</ref>\n\nThe Red Skull, now in a clone body of Steve Rogers, lures Walker to Washington, D.C. The Skull attacks Walker with a horde of Walker's enemies, but Walker kills or critically injures them all in a single brawl. The Red Skull arranges for Walker to confront Captain America - now using the identity and costume of 'the Captain' - but Rogers defeats him and confronts the Red Skull. Walker wakes up and throws his shield at the Red Skull, causing him to be exposed to his own \"dust of death,\" giving his head a reddish skull appearance, but the Skull escapes. Rogers and Walker give a report to the Commission, which returns the uniform of Captain America to Steve Rogers. Rogers declines the offer, but Walker persuades him to reconsider and accept it. At a press conference announcing the return of the original Captain America, General Haywerth fakes Walker's assassination by a Watchdog in order to set up John Walker in a new identity.<ref>''Captain America'' #350-351</ref> To address Walker's psychosis, he is hypnotized into believing his parents are still alive and he would not recover his full memory for many years.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n===U.S. Agent===\nWalker soon resurfaced as an adventurer, the U.S. Agent, wearing a variation of the costume that Rogers had worn as the Captain and using his [[vibranium]] disc as a shield. Walker continued to work for the Commission. He was first seen as the U.S. Agent, battling an [[Iron Monger]] as a test for the Commission.<ref>''Captain America'' #354</ref> He was placed as a watchdog of [[West Coast Avengers]] and the Vision by the Commission, as a condition to possibly get their government clearance reinstated.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #44-45</ref> Some time later, he rescued Battlestar from the Power Broker, and reconciled with him; Walker learned that his memories had been altered and that his parents were dead.<ref>''Captain America'' #376-378</ref>\n\nWhile under the employ of the Commission for Superhuman Activities, U.S. Agent was charged with the responsibility of taking down the [[Punisher]] (Frank Castle). U.S. Agent locates the Punisher and after some hand-to-hand combat, the Punisher discloses that he is attempting to take down the Maggia; he agrees to help the Punisher, vowing to take him into custody once they had done so. Agent takes down the superpowered mercenary [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], who had been employed to kill the Punisher by the Maggia, breaking both of his legs with his shield. Ultimately the Punisher upon completing his mission escapes U.S. Agent by dressing a deceased henchman in his uniform and leaving him in a burning building, convincing U.S.Agent that he had perished in the fire. U.S. Agent is berated by his employers who inform him that his job is to act, not think and declaring that it is no wonder that he failed as Captain America. U.S. Agent walks away half way through his dressing-down.<ref>The Punisher 'No Escape' original graphic novel (1990)</ref>\n\nU.S. Agent fought alongside the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in several battles. After the Avengers moved to a [[United Nations]] based charter, he received only one vote (though not from himself) in the ensuing vote and consequently lost his place on the team.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' vol. 2 #69</ref> Even with his personality conflicts and reckless behavior, he soon proved himself worthy of being an Avenger and was able to rejoin.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' vol. 2 #74</ref>\n\nU.S. Agent along with the rest of the West Coast Avengers, the Avengers and the X-Men, participated in the 'Bloodties' crossover,<ref>''Avengers'' #368</ref> during which [[Professor X]] attempted to negotiate a peace to end the civil war on the island of Genosha.{{issue|date=January 2013}} U.S. Agent was charged with the responsibility of acting as bodyguard for Professor X.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nCaptain America sarcastically cited U.S. Agent's use of his \"famous powers of composure and diplomacy\" as one example of the recent failings of the West Coast Avengers when he indicated his intention to shut the team down. This provoked U.S. Agent's fury, who raised his hand to strike Captain America; Iron Man stopped him and uttered, \"Not now. Not ever\".<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #102</ref>\n\nDuring this time, U.S. Agent was featured in a [[Marvel UK]] comic called ''[[Super Soldiers]]'', teaming up with American and British soldiers empowered by a variation of the drugs that created [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n===Force Works===\nWhen the [[West Coast Avengers]] dissolved, he dumped his U.S. Agent costume and shield into the [[Hudson River]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' vol. 2 #102</ref> Soon after, most of the then-current members of the West Coast Avengers were asked by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] to found [[Force Works]]. Initially the Agent was reluctant, however [[Scarlet Witch]] later persuaded him to join, stating that she needed the Agent to be the team's \"backbone\" and intended to run the team on tight military lines and the values of strength and dedication that Agent had shown her during their time together on the West Coast Avengers. U.S. Agent ultimately joined the new team, wearing a new costume and using an energy-based shield.<ref name=autogenerated4>''Force Works'' #1</ref>\n\nU.S. Agent remained a member throughout the team's tenure, fighting threats such as the [[Kree]],<ref name=autogenerated4 /> alien parasites The Scatter,<ref>''Force Works'' #2-3</ref> Slorenian supernatural threat Ember, Slorenia's armored protectors Black Brigade,<ref>''Force Works'' #4-5</ref> The Mandarin,<ref>''Force Works'' #6-7</ref> fighting alongside Australian super hero Dreamguard (Willie Walkaway) against the dream-manipulating Orphan,<ref>''Force Works'' #9-10</ref> Slorenia's undead shock troops The Targoth and Volkhvy the Eternal One,<ref>''Force Works'' #11-12</ref> teaming up with the Avengers against the Kree commandos Excel,<ref>''Force Works'' #13-14</ref> intergalactic mercenary The Broker,<ref>''Force Works'' #15</ref> battling Force Works' own rogue security system VIRGIL,<ref>''Force Works'' #20</ref> and an alternate reality version of deceased former Force Works member Wonder Man (Simon Williams).<ref>''Force Works'' #21-22</ref>\n\n===Heroes Return===\nU.S. Agent was briefly referred to as the Liegeman in ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #2-3 as it was the codename for him in the [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] verse.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 3 #1-3</ref>\n\nU.S. Agent briefly appears in ''Captain America'' (Vol 3) during the 'American Nightmare' story arc attempting to steal an experimental jet plane.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Captain America stops him,{{issue|date=January 2013}} and U.S. Agent is later seen in stasis along with others affected by the villain Nightmare.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nHe eventually became the field leader of [[The Jury (comics)|the Jury]], a group of armored corporate vigilantes, owned by [[Edwin Cord]], owner of Cordco. U.S. Agent again wearing his original U.S. Agent uniform and now using an eagle-shaped shield that could be directed in midair via remote control. The Jury's job was to take down the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], but they were defeated by the Thunderbolts and their new leader [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], a former Avenger teammate of Walker's.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #23</ref> The Jury attempted to apprehend the Thunderbolts a second time, but instead the two groups joined forces together against Brute Force and the soldiers of the Secret Empire.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nU.S. Agent was severely beaten to near death by [[Protocide]]. Due to emergency medical procedures performed on him, he was outfitted, by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], with an enhancing exo-skeleton.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n===S.T.A.R.S===\nFollowing his recovery, he soon adopted a new costume and rejoined the Commission on Superhuman Activities, with the position at the head of the federal government's [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] division, called S.T.A.R.S., the Superhuman Tactical Activities Response Squad. The group battled alien invaders and superhuman threats and was responsible for their imprisonment.<ref>''U.S. Agent'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> In this role, he was placed in charge of coordinating Earth's heroes during the '[[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]]' crisis when Earth became a prison planet, claiming that he was needed to prevent the other heroes getting 'sidetracked' by their concern for the prisoners to ensure that their focus remained on what was best for Earth.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nU.S. Agent continued to work for S.T.A.R.S as America's super human 'top cop' under the observation of Valerie Cooper. In this role his former love, and current agent of S.H.I.E.L.D, Kali Vries - who he had endured Army boot-camp with many years previously, and who had bested him in almost all physical tests - was thrust upon him as second in command. U.S. Agent was uncomfortable with Vries' appointment as she had previously jilted him, although she was still affectionate towards him. Other S.T.A.R.S agents warned Agent that Vries was playing him. Vries is later revealed to be in the employ of ambitious Senator Warkovsky and on his order places a parasite capable of allowing mind control on U.S. Agent's neck.<ref>''U.S. Agent'' Vol 2 #1</ref>\n\nIn their second mission together U.S. Agent and Vries teamed up to tackle a radical faction of Atlantians working with the super-villain [[Poundcakes]] (Marian Pouncey). It transpired that Pouncey was attempting to trade more of the alien parasites capable of mind control with the Atlantians. The Sub-Mariner (Namor) disrupts the battle and discovers the parasite placed on U.S. Agent's neck by Vries. Vries later attends Agent's room and attempts to seduce him, placing another parasite on him. U.S. Agent - apparently no longer in control of his own will, and despite being informed that a S.H.I.E.L.D envoy had been dispatched  - then takes the duffle bag full of parasites seized by S.T.A.R.S in order to take them to his manipulator who transpires to be none other than the [[Power Broker]] (Curtis Jackson) - the man originally responsible for granting John Walker his super-human powers, whose plan is to infect the International assemblage of Heads of State with the mind-controlling parasites.<ref>''U.S. Agent'' Vol 2 #2</ref>\n\nAt this point Captain America (Steve Rogers), who had been revealed to be the S.H.I.E.L.D envoy responsible for collecting the parasites, along with Kali Vries, burst into the meeting between U.S. Agent and the Power Broker. Power Broker places a parasite on the neck of Senator Warkovsky intent upon influencing his address to the International assemblage of Heads of State, but is interrupted by U.S. Agent who is subsequently assaulted by Captain America intent upon stopping him. The two battle with neither of them able to gain the upper hand. Meanwhile, Vries is captured by the Power Broker who reveals that he had been attacked and left for dead by aliens during the 'Maximum Security' crisis at which point, barely alive, he had become the host for an alien which produced the mind-controlling parasites, subsequently attempting to expand its control by infecting influential individuals. Power Broker then infects Vries with a parasite. Eventually Agent manages to escape Captain Americas attentions long enough to reveal the presence of the parasite on Senator Warkovsky's neck and removes it with his energy baton. Together Cap and Agent fight off the crowd of V.I.P's (also apparently under the control of the Power Broker), escaping and then teaming up to restrain both Power Broker and Vries and removing the parasites from each of them. Dum Dum Dugan then appears on the scene to inform U.S. Agent that Vries, far from being a traitor, was actually a deep cover agent acting on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D with the intention of gaining Senator Warkovsky's confidence and discovering who was using the parasites and attempting to take the mother-parasite into custody for study and as evidence. Agent destroys the specimen and then speculates that he didn't believe it to be alien at all but rather a product of a government genetics lab that went wrong. Dugan is suspicious by his silence and shocked when Captain America indicates that he believes U.S. Agent's accusation. U.S. Agent is later seen deep in thought, looking at a photo of himself and Vries during better times and reading a letter of apology from her for her deceptions. He later burns the photo before running out of his room after being informed that there is an assignment for him, declaring \"I love this job!\"<ref>''U.S. Agent'' Vol 2 #3</ref>\n\n===Invaders===\n[[Image:New Invaders -1.jpg|thumb|right|Clockwise from top left: [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch (Jim Hammond)]], [[Captain America]], [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)]], U.S. Agent, and [[Blazing Skull]] on the cover to ''New Invaders'' #1, with art by [[Scott Kolins]].]]\nWalker eventually became a member of the New Invaders,<ref name=autogenerated2>''Avengers'' Vol3 #82</ref> wearing a Captain America-like costume.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> When most of that group disbanded in the wake of the apparent death of the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|original Human Torch]],{{issue|date=August 2012}} U.S. Agent, [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]] (Chapman), and the [[Blazing Skull]] remained together for a time before disbanding.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nWalker insisted on being called Captain America.<ref>''The New Invaders'' #1 and #2</ref> Captain America (Steve Rogers), while attempting to close down the New Invaders, threatened Walker with legal action over his use of the uniform, stating that he owned the copyright to it. Walker informed Rogers that he had only taken the role in the first place because Rogers had refused the [[Thin Man (comics)|Thin Man]]'s invitation to lead the team and that they had to show their enemies \"that Captain America isn't afraid to fight!\"<ref>''The New Invaders'' #8</ref>\n\nWhilst Walker proved to be unpopular with many of his new allies, he later gained their respect, in particular winning over Namor who had been a close ally of the original Captain America, Steve Rogers. Walker saved Namor from a brainwashed and murderous Wolverine, who had been resurrected by The Hand during the 'Enemy of the State' storyline. The badly injured Namor later offered Walker his personal thanks.<ref>''The New Invaders'' #6</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nIn the special one-shot ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: Choosing Sides]]'', U.S. Agent must choose between the government to which he has always remained loyal or the man whose legend he attempted to uphold. As a strong trading partner to the U.S., Canada is vulnerable and without a superhero team due to the death of [[Alpha Flight]]. The U.S. Government offers him the position to lead a newly formed team called [[Omega Flight]]. He is attacked by [[Purple Man]] and agrees to serve his country by going to Canada and consequently joins Omega Flight.<ref>''Omega Flight'' #1-5 (April-Aug. 2007)</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/07/29/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-210/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics \u2013 Day 210 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=July 29, 2010 |accessdate=September 28, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Civil War: The Initiative]]'' U.S. Agent was a part of the line-up of Omega Flight. He was assigned to the team as an American representative, but is personally motivated out of hate towards the Purple Man who humiliated him and stole his shield.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n===Omega Flight===\nAs an employee of Omega Flight, U.S. Agent is given the responsibility of training [[Weapon Omega]] (Michael Pointer).{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nDuring a mission to take down un-registered super-criminal Tentakill, Weapon Omega passes out mid-combat for unknown reasons forcing U.S. Agent to detain the criminal single handed. Weapon Omega's unusual behaviour rouses U.S. Agent's suspicions, who is later seen to be communicating covertly with an unknown source.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nIt later transpires that Weapon Omega is being manipulated by Omega Flight's handler Agent Brown as well as his psychologist Dr. Benning, but worse than that unregistered super-criminals are being detained, no record being made of their detention, and their powers being used to fuel Weapon Omega's energy absorbing power, resulting in the deaths of several of the inmates who are completely drained of life.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nIt is later revealed that U.S. Agent is acting on behalf of Tony Stark (Iron Man), who is monitoring Weapon Omega's progress and requires U.S. Agent to obtain the data analysis of Omega's powers as well as the details of his private consultations with Omega Flight's psychologists.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nBefore his departure Stark, due to his lack of knowledge that recently detained super-villain Rap-tor had been detained - despite having access to all prisoner manifests - unknowingly confirms Agent's suspicions that super-villains detained by Omega Flight are not being officially recorded and that the villains are subsequently disappearing without explanation.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nU.S. Agent's suspicions grow when Weapon Omega is not seen for weeks at a time. He is repeatedly told by Agent Brown that Omega is simply unwell and resting. [[Arachne]] (Julia Carpenter), acting with U.S. Agent in order to uncover the conspiracy, spies and informs him that Weapon Omega isn't resting and for some reason he is being constantly observed.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nDuring their next training session U.S. Agent is easily besting Weapon Omega in combat when Omega's handlers increase the flow of power from the super-powered detainees. This results in Omega losing control as he manifests the various powers of numerous inmates, breaking U.S. Agent's ankle before manifesting the reptillian powers of Rap-tor, beating and lacerating U.S. Agent almost to death - an assault only stopped by the interference of Sasquatch (Walter Langkowski). U.S. Agent tries to warn Weapon Omega - who is shocked at his loss of control - that power is being fed into him via his suit, but is sedated before he is able to do so.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nWeapon Omega eventually realizes that he is being manipulated and that his handlers intend to continue to use him even against his will, however this is stopped by the U.S. Agent who having discharged himself from the infirmary despite his severe injuries. Dr. Benning boasts that as a fail-safe had been activated, all evidence of her manipulation of Weapon Omega had been destroyed. It is at this point that Omega reveals that one of the individuals whose powers he had absorbed had been a technopath, and that he had accessed all of Benning's confidential records and sent them to Tony Stark. Weapon Omega then exposes Benning to a glimpse of the hundreds of personalities within his being, leaving her in a vegetative state.

Their mission is to stop Norman Osborn's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] from stealing Odin's spear from the Asgardian armory. After engaging the Thunderbolts in battle, [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] uses the spear to sever U.S. Agent's left arm and leg.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Mighty Avengers'' #35</ref>\n\nAs thanks for his service during the siege of Asgard, John Walker is appointed the new [[Prison warden|warden]] of [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]] maximum security prison. The injuries he sustained during his fight with Nuke have left him wheelchair bound and using a prosthetic arm. He refuses to repair his body using more technologically advanced prostheses because he does not want to become a cyborg like the man who crippled him.<ref name=autogenerated6>''Thunderbolts'' #145</ref> Walker engaged an inmate in hand-to-hand combat during a prison riot, demonstrating that he could still hold his own despite some limitations.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #147</ref> The warden was influential in establishing the new Thunderbolts beta team, appointing [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] team leader and handpicking the new candidates.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #155</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' event, [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] heavily damaged the Raft before escaping, causing a prison break.

The figure was merely a repaint of the previously released Captain America action figure.\n\n* In 1995, ToyBiz released an action figure line for the 1994 ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' animated series. A U.S. Agent action figure was produced but never made it to mass market. However, the figure eventually did get released in international markets and the odd short packed case. It became one of the more valuable figures in the line. ToyBiz did release the original version of the figure at a convention, that version usually sells for 2-3 times more than that of the international release. The figure was later remolded to become the Astral Armor [[Professor Xavier]] in the [[X-Men]] toy line.\n\n* U.S. Agent is in the Marvel minimates license. He is a two inch figure that comes with his shield, and a repainting of [[Blade (comics)|Blade's]] belt.
