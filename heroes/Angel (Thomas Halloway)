Thomas' mother died in childbirth - consequently he was brought up in the prison where his father was a warden. There he was instructed by a number of experts, as well as a number of the inmates, which gave him a unique insight into the underworld. He earned his moniker when he saved one of these inmates from the chair. Though he wore a costume like a superhero, he wore no mask to conceal his identity.

Confronted by [[U.S. Agent]], Angel was wounded during the battle and arrested for his part in the murders of the Scourge of the Underworld.

In modern times, he was living as a homeless man in and beneath [[Manhattan]], where he was ambushed and murdered by the [[supervillain]] [[Everyman (Marvel Comics)|Zeitgeist]].<ref name=\"newxmen21\">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]] | Penciller =  [[Dave Hoover]] & [[Sandu Florea]] | Inker = [[Dan Bulanadi]] | Story = Broad Stripes And White Stars | Title = Captain America | Issue = 442 | Date = August 1995 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>  He has also appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #432-433 (Aug.-Sept. 1995) and in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' vol. 3, #7 (Oct. 1991). It is unknown what occurred between the brothers and why Tom's brother ended up homeless.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThomas Halloway had no superpowers but was a skilled detective. He also wore the Mystic Cape of Mercury, which granted him the ability to fly. \n\n==Other versions==\nAn alternate version of the Angel, appears in ''[[X-Men Noir]]'', investigating the death of [[Jean Grey]]. This Angel, Thomas Halloway, is depicted as private investigator and the child of the warden of a prison called the Welfare Pen. Thomas' mother died in childbirth - consequently he was brought up in the prison where his father was a warden. There he was instructed by a number of experts, as well as a number of the inmates, which gave him a unique insight into the underworld. He earned his moniker when he saved one of these inmates from the chair. Though he wore a costume like a superhero, he wore no mask to conceal his identity.\n\nThe final issue reveals that the Angel identity is shared by twins: the idealistic Tom Halloway and his ruthless brother '''Robert Halloway'''. Robert sacrifices himself to stop Jean, revealed as having killed [[Rogue (comics)#Marvel Noir|Anne-Marie Rankin]] and taken her place.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/g/gaangel.htm The Angel] at International Hero\n\n\n\n{{GoldenAge}}\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1939]]\n[[Category:Golden Age superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional surgeons]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Timely Comics characters]]"}]}}}}
