She is the daughter of mutant [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigine]] refugees (their ancestor is the mutant [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]]) who fled Australia for America the day before it was devastated in a nuclear attack.  Shard was born and raised in a mutant concentration camp, in which mutants were branded over their right eyes with the letter \\"M\\" for recognition.  In [[Uncanny X-Men]] Annual #17, Shard is stated as having the mutant ability of \\"transubbing ambient light into concussive force\\".{{issue|date=December 2012}}\\n\\nShard became the youngest X.S.E. graduate a year after Bishop attained that position.  She served under Bishop as a member of the Omega Squad (which included Bishop and his officers, Randall and Malcolm), until her promotion.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\\n\\nTogether, in the X.S.E. Shard and Bishop were responsible for apprehending criminal mutants.  Shard was partially infected on a mission with her brother fighting a group infected with a vampire-like affliction originating from the present day mutant, [[Emplate]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}\\n\\nAlthough Emplates are considered the \\"living dead\\", Bishop took her to the New York Stark/Fujikawa building inhabited by the [[Alternative versions of Gambit#Bishop\'future|Witness]] in order to attempt to save her life by transmitting her essence into a holographic matrix (a technology of [[Shi\'ar]] origin, akin to that used in the X-Men\'s [[Danger Room]]).  Here he was said to have made a deal in order for the experiment to even happen in the first place, the price being that he would work for him for a specified period of time.  The experiment was a success, but Shard, already partially infected with the Emplate affliction, died.  Due to the process involved, Bishop considered himself her murderer.{{issue|date=December 2012}}  The extent of, as well as the type of work he did in this deal is still yet to be known, if it ever will be.<ref>\'\'Messiah Complex\'\' TPB</ref>\\n\\nBishop eventually travelled back in time, to the present, in an effort to track down [[Trevor Fitzroy]], one of his time\'s most-wanted criminals and Shard\'s ex-lover, where he became stuck in the present day and became a member of the [[X-Men]], his idols.  Shard has also since been recreated in the present, as a computer construct, and became a clandestine member of the government-sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team. There, she began a romantic relationship with her teammate [[Wildchild (comics)|Wildchild]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}\\n\\nAfter X-Factor disbanded in \'\'X-Factor #149\'\', Shard was transported into an alternate future. There she died for the second and apparently final time, saving her brother Bishop.<ref>\'\'Bishop: the Last X-Man #14\'\'</ref> from Trevor Fitzroy, her former paramour who had attempted to seduce her into becoming his consort once again by restoring her body to its original solid form.\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nShard is able to absorb ambient light particles and convert/transsub it to allow her to perform a number of light based attacks. Due to Shard\'s current living condition as a photon based life form, she is granted a form of intangibility.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television=== \\n* Shard appears in the \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]\'\' episodes \\"One Man\'s Worth\\" pt. 1 & 2 and \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" pt. 1-4. She was voiced by [[Kay Tremblay]].\\n\\n===Video games===\\n* In \'\'[[X-Men 3: Mojo World]]\'\' she is a playable character after unlocked in level 4.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/08/20/shard-bishop/ World of Black Heroes: Shard Biography]\\n*[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/characters/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=941 Uncannyxmen.net character bio on Shard]\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shard (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics titles]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can turn intangible]]\\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
