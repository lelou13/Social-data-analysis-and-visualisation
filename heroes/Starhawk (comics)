Arcturian computer records depicted in \'\'Marvel Presents\'\' referred to him as \'Stakar of the House of Ogord\' rather than \'Stakar Ogord\'.

He is an [[antihero]] in the [[Earth-691]] [[timeline]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].\\n\\nStakar was fated to eventually re-inhabit his infant body, reliving his life over countless times.  Because of the knowledge of things to come, he manipulated events to affect what he felt would be the best outcome, referring to himself as \'\'\'\\"One Who Knows\\"\'\'\'.

That next issue, though, and all subsequent issues of the title, were reprints of older Marvel material. The unused cover of the Starhawk feature from \'\'Marvel Super-Heroes\'\' was used as the cover of the third issue of \'\'[[Marvelmania]]\'\', Marvel\'s in-house fanzine, and the first part of the unused story itself, by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Dan Adkins]], was printed in \'\'Marvelmania\'\' #6. Though the serialization was to continue in the next issue, the title was cancelled before that happened.<ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/starhawkmsh.htm|John Kaminski\'s profile of the character}}</ref>\\n\\nThe in-continuity Starhawk first appeared in \'\'[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]\'\' #27 (Sep 1975), and was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]]. It is unclear whether this Starhawk has any connection to the \'\'Marvel Super-Heroes\'\' character.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n===Origin===\\nA male child was born to the superheroes [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] and [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet]] in the about the year 2002 of the [[Earth-691]] [[alternate timeline|timeline]].<ref>Kismet discovered she was pregnant during War of the Worlds, which commenced in June 2001, according to \'\'Marvel Graphic Novel\'\' #7.</ref>  As such, he was half [[human]] and half-artificially created being.  Just as soon as he was born on the planet Vesper, he was kidnapped and deposited on the planet [[Arcturus]] IV.  The baby was discovered by an Arcturian couple who were among the last of their planet\'s [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]; for much of his life, Stakar would believe that these mutants were his birth parents.  The mutants were found and slain by the Reavers of Arcturus, Arcturian military cadres dedicated to eradicating the mutants of their race.  The Reaver Ogord discovered the infant and, assuming him to be a normal Arcturian, adopted the child and raised it as his own with his wife Salaan, naming the boy Stakar.<ref>\'\'Marvel Presents\'\' #9</ref>\\n\\nStakar cultivated an interest in [[science]] and [[archaeology]] and explored ruins containing the Hawk God.  Around the year 2020,<ref>Stakar was approaching the Arcturian age of manhood, which would have been at least 18 years after 2002.</ref> he and his adoptive sister [[Aleta Ogord]] reanimated the dormant deity and were physically transformed. They took turns occupying the same physical space, while the other stayed in a type of \\"limbo\\". They were given extraordinary power and left Arcturus IV for the stars; when dominant, Stakar adopted the costumed identity of Starhawk. Developing romantic feelings for one another, Stakar and Aleta petitioned the Hawk God to temporarily separate them. During this time, they had three children together: Sita, John and Tara.<ref>\'\'Marvel Presents\'\' #9-10</ref>\\n\\n===Guardians of the Galaxy===\\nAs an adventurer and protector, Starhawk revealed himself to the Guardians of the Galaxy and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] in the year 3014.  He aided them in overthrowing the [[Badoon]] occupation of Earth.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #27</ref> Starhawk joined the Guardians of the Galaxy in a space mission, and helped defeat the [[Topographical Man]].<ref>\'\'Marvel Presents\'\' #3-7</ref> It is later revealed he manipulated events to bring the Guardians together; for example, when Charlie-27 teleported from Jupiter to escape the Badoon, Starhawk caused him to be transported to Pluto where he met Martinex.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #26, cover-dated July 1992</ref>\\n\\nDuring this time, Stakar\'s three children (Tara, John and Sita) were changed into energy vampires by Aleta\'s father and sent to kill Stakar. They died of accelerated old age. Aleta thereafter blamed Stakar (rather than her father) for the deaths of their children, and their relationship never recovered.<ref>\'\'Marvel Presents\'\' #9-11</ref>\\n\\nStarhawk teamed with the time-traveling [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and battled [[Korvac]] and his Minions of Menace.<ref>\'\'Thor Annual\'\' #6</ref> Starhawk later traveled to the 1970s alongside his fellow Guardians, and assisted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in battle against [[Korvac]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #167-168, 170, 173, 175-177</ref> Alongside the Guardians, the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)#Dargo Ktor|Dargo]], and [[Silver Surfer|Keeper]], Starhawk battled manifestations of Korvac\'s power in various eras.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four Annual\'\' #24; \'\'Thor Annual\'\' #16; \'\'Silver Surfer Annual\'\' #4; \'\'Guardians of the Galaxy Annual\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\nIn 3017, Starhawk accompanied the Guardians on a quest to find the lost [[Captain America\'s shield|shield]] of [[Captain America]]. He battled [[Taserface]] and the [[Stark (species)|Stark]], and was physically separated from Aleta in an accident.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #1-4</ref>  Aleta was the stronger of the pair, and Stakar forcibly reabsorbed her to sustain himself.  The two struggled for dominance of their physical space, and Stakar metemorphosed into a \'dark\' version of himself, projecting \'black light\'.\\n\\nBecause of Stakar\'s assault on their teammate, the Guardians chose to expel him from the team.  Eventually, Aleta became dominant, and reverted Stakar\'s body to an infant state.  Aware of his destiny, she sent him back in time to begin his life cycle again.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #32-33</ref>\\n\\n===Freed from rebirth===\\nWhen the Guardians traveled back in time to the 20th century of [[Earth-616]], their native timeline was altered - to the extent that Starhawk had lived his entire life over again and was waiting for their arrival. Stakar and Aleta had harsh words for each other, and the Hawk God appeared and intervened, attaching the two ex-lovers by bonding their fingers together.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #45</ref> After being forced to work together for a time, the Hawk God again granted them audience, allowing them to plead their cases.  He separated them and allowed only Stakar to retain his power, while Aleta was given back her former power to manipulate light.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #50</ref>\\n\\nAleta then chose to stay with the Guardians, while the Hawk God told Stakar the truth about his ancestry.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #51</ref> He then went on a quest to learn more. During this quest he found the wounded Silver Surfer, whom he healed and equipped his Quantum Bands for a short time. Eon then reveals to Stakar that his biological father Quasar once wore the bands. Starhawk is then consumed by Abrogate, a place where all former Quantum-Band wielders go after death. Quasar tells him about his lover and Stakar\'s mother [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet]]. Stakar finds her alive and living in a secluded religious retreat on the planet Vesper.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy #62</ref> After that, a creature who called himself Era, the son of [[Eon (comics)|Eon]], revealed himself. It admitted having kidnapped Stakar at birth, along with other vile deeds.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy #62</ref>\\n\\nWith the encouragement of the Hawk God, Starhawk and Kismet dedicated themselves to locating and confronting Era.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy #62</ref>\\n\\n[[Image:Starhawk_GotG_vol2_issue5.jpg|thumb|200px|Starhawk as a female. From \'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' vol. 2, #5 (November 2008), art by [[Paul Pelletier]].]]\\n\\n===Return===\\nUsing some technology from his timeline, Starhawk teleports himself into the 21st century of the [[Earth-616]] timeline, to meet up with that era\'s equivalent of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] on [[Knowhere]]. [[Vance Astro]], aka Major Victory, was found by this new squad of Guardians, and Starhawk fights him before teleporting away.<ref name=\\"GotGv2_3\\">\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' vol. 2, #3 (Sept. 2008)</ref> Starhawk again ventures to Knowhere, but this time appears as a woman. Claiming that there are not meant to be Guardians of the Galaxy at this point in the timeline, and that Major Victory\'s appearance there has put the entire future in flux, she again attempts to kill Astro and the Guardians.<ref name=\\"GotGv2_5\\">\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' vol. 2, #5 (Nov. 2008)</ref> She is detained by the Guardians,<ref name=\\"GotGv2_6\\">\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' vol. 2, #6 (Dec. 2008)</ref> and held captive for a time, until [[Moondragon]] released her.<ref name=\\"GotGv2_15\\">\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' vol. 2, #15 (Aug. 2009)</ref> She discovers that the anomaly that is disturbing the time stream is not Astro or the Guardians, but instead [[Black Bolt]] activating a bomb that will cause time and space to collapse. Starhawk sacrifices her life to save the Guardians, and instructs [[Star-Lord]] to stop Black Bolt, at any cost.<ref name=\\"GotGv2_16\\">\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' vol. 2, #16 (Sept. 2009)</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThe true extent of Starhawk\'s powers is unknown, but they are said to be immense in nature. He has an incredibly long lifespan, possibly inherited from his mother or due to his empowerment by the Hawk God.\\n\\nStarhawk can manipulate light to create concussive force blasts of [[photon]]ic energy, heat, and solid-light constructs. He can also fly at the speed of light by tapping anti-gravitons, and survive in the vacuum of space.  By tapping into Aleta\'s powers (when merged with her), he can also generate solid constructs of light; it is unknown if he can do so since their separation.  His natural senses, especially eyesight, are enhanced to a superhuman degree; in addition, his powers give him extrasensory sensitivity to energy patterns and fluctuations in his environment, and he can track energy trails across intergalactic distances.\\n\\nHe has superhuman strength and durability, and he can enhance these further by reinforcing his body with light energy; on one occasion, he was able to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He has an immunity to most known diseases and radiation sickness.\\n\\nHe seemingly has [[precognition]], designating himself as \\"One-Who-Knows\\", but this is actually an effect of remembering what happened in his previous life cycle.  However, due to Starhawk\'s efforts to change events for the better in each cycle, as well as the manipulations of beings with greater understanding of the universe (such as [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]), these memories can become unreliable; the overall thrust of events may be the same, but vital details might differ from his previous incarnation.\\n\\nWhen he forced Aleta to re-merge with him after their second separation, Starhawk\'s power changed from light to dark, and he was able to create constructs out of solid darkness, and fire blasts of shadowy force.  Valentino had initially decided to call him [[Shadowhawk]], but [[Tom DeFalco]] convinced him to save the name for a brand new character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=144&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=15&sid=fd50fa9bc46f3072e79db765589e9e5a |title=View topic - Guardians thread |publisher=Image Comics |date= |accessdate=2011-04-09}}</ref>\\n\\nStakar has knowledge of the archaeology of the planet Arcturus IV.
