He was recruited into training at the [[Avengers Academy]] to become an Avenger.<ref name = \"Avengers Academy #1\"/>\n\n==Publication history==\nMettle first appeared in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #1 (June 2010) and was created by [[Christos Gage]] and [[Mike McKone]]. He appeared as a regular character in the series through its final issue, #39 (Jan 2013).\n\nMettle appeared briefly in ''[[Avengers Arena]]'', the successor title to ''Avengers Academy'', by [[Dennis Hopeless]] and [[Kev Walker]].<ref name=\"AvengersArena\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40986 |title=Hopeless and Walker Populate \"Avengers Arena\" For Marvel NOW! |last=Sunu |first=Steve |date=13 September 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nKen Mack was a sixteen-year old Hawaiian surfer with a laid back and carefree attitude. While surfing, another surfer hit him with a surf board and ripped away part of his face, which revealed a red [[iridium]] skull at the point of impact. He was taken to [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], where Dr. [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]] explained that the trauma accelerated his transformation that was already taking place. Norman Osborn accelerated the transformation, changing Ken's body to be completely iridium.<ref name = \"Avengers Academy #4\">''Avengers Academy'' #4 (November 2010)</ref>\n\n===Heroic Age===\nMettle is recruited into the [[Avengers Academy]] along with five other students who have been affected by Osborn. In a sparring session with [[Reptil]] he is shown to withstand intense heat from a flame thrower with no effect. Noticing that they have been joined by [[Veil (comics)#Avengers Academy|Veil]], he comments on her costume, but she becomes frightened by his appearance, changing into her gas form.\n\nHe is portrayed as a more responsible member of the new recruits, after discovering that they will all have a training session with [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] and [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]]. [[Striker (comics)|Striker]] complains in relation to the incident at Stamford stating that Speedball was stupid in his battle with [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]]. Mettle instead stated that he would be the perfect teacher, given their abilities one wrong move and any of one them could be a potential murderer. During their training session, Speedball increases the difficulty with Hazmat responding with a radiation blast. Justice suggests that he take a break. Then [[Finesse (comics)|Finesse]] notices Speedball and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] arguing about keeping a secret from the cadets. By accessing secret computer files, the students realize that they are not the most powerful, nor the smartest or even the most highly trained kids that Osborn kidnapped. Instead they have been chosen for the academy because they have the greatest potential to go rogue and become dangerous villains.<ref name = \"Avengers Academy #1\">''Avengers Academy'' #1 (June 2010)</ref>\n\nOn a visit to the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]], Mettle, [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]], and [[Veil (comics)|Veil]] plan to seek out Norman Osborn in his cell to kill him for revenge. Hazmat used her power to cause a blackout, giving them enough time for Mettle to rip the Osborn's cell door. However, they let him live when Osborn said he could fix them. When the students were questioned about who cause the blackout, Mettle lied and said it seemed like fate led them to Osborn.<ref name = \"Avengers Academy #4\"/> Mettle has fought against [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]], [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], [[Mentallo]], and the [[Absorbing Man]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #5-7 (Dec. 2010 - Feb. 2011)</ref> After a video of Tigra's assault by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], Mettle refused to go with Hazmat, Veil, and Striker to get revenge.<ref name = \"Avengers Academy #8\">''Avengers Academy'' #8 (March 2011)</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to bring back the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], Veil mistakenly resurrects Carina Walters, [[Korvac]] senses her and arrives to take her back. When Carina refuses to go with him, Korvac attacks, but the Avengers show up to battle him. Carina temporarily transforms Mettle and his teammates to obtain powers from their future selves in order to defeat Korvac. He punches through Korvac, thinking that he killed him. It is later revealed that his future-self seemed comfortable with killing, which scares Mettle. After the fight, Mettle seeks out Hazmat in the student's lounge where they share an emotional moment knowing that they may never be cured.<ref name = \"Avengers Academy #11\">''Avengers Academy'' #11 (May 2011)</ref>\n\nAt the Prom, Mettle and Hazmat shared their thoughts and feelings to each other and decided to start a romantic relationship.<ref name = \"Avengers Academy #13\">''Avengers Academy'' #13 (June 2011)</ref>\n\n===Fear Itself===\nIn the [[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]] storyline, Mettle throws a pole at an armor robot attacking Washington D.C., killing both the pilot and gunner. He feels guilt for doing so, but Tigra reassures him that by killing him, he saved the lives of innocent civilians. When [[Titania (She-Hulk)|Titania]] and the Absorbing Man attacks the Infinite Mansion, Mettle and Hazmat chose to hold them back and sacrifice themselves in order for their teammates to escape. However, the Avengers Academy instructors show up to save them.<ref name = \"Avengers Academy #19\">''Avengers Academy'' #19 (November 2011)</ref> In the aftermath of Fear Itself, Mettle and Hazmat attempt to have sex, but Hazmat was still traumatized over her previous boyfriend.<ref name = \"Avengers Academy #20\">''Avengers Academy'' #20 (December 2011)</ref>\n\n===Avengers Arena and death===\nAfter finally having sex with [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]] while the teachers (and most students) were away, Mettle is abducted alongside Hazmat, [[Reptil]], [[X-23]], [[Juston Seyfert]], and a dozen others by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] on Christmas Eve during the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event. Mettle is apparently killed by Arcade in Murderworld, as he sacrificed himself to spare Hazmat as the weak link among the 16.<ref name = \"Avengers Arena #1\">''Avengers Arena'' #1 (December 2012)</ref> When suspicions arise as to where the abductees have gone, Arcade activates the \"contingency\", using a remotely operated copy of Mettle to assuage the worries of Hank Pym and explain away the absence of the teen heroes.{{issue|date=December 2013}} When [[Deathlocket]] stumbles into an underground facility, Mettle's body is among the bodies that are seen in one of the rooms.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #12</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nPossesses a body of living Iridium, he is virtually indestructible shown to be able to withstand the intense heat of a flame thrower. His costume is made of \"unstable molecules\" that [[Mister Fantastic]] designed, which is able to adjust to his powers.<ref name = \"Avengers Academy #1\"/> He has superhuman strength and durability due to his body, but he is unable to transform back into his human form. However due to the tampering of Norman Osborn he is unable to feel the basic of human sensations due to deteriorated nerve endings and remains closed off from the world. Mettle has been shown that he does not know his own strength and is fearful of his powers.\n\nBefore obtaining his iridium body, Ken Mack was an experienced surfer.\n\n==Other versions==\nMettle appears as a zombie in Marvel Zombies Halloween, attacking Kitty Pryde and her son Peter with other zombies, but is seemingly repelled by Mephisto.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Reception==\nIn an article for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Jerome Maida describes Mettle as an \"invulnerable powerhouse\".<ref>http://articles.philly.com/2010-09-13/entertainment/24974022_1_hazmat-second-chances-young-heroes</ref>\n\nA review of ''Avengers Academy'' #14.1 by David Pepose for [[Newsarama]] expressed his love of the expressions artist [[Sean Chen (artist)|Sean Chen]] gives to the characters, including Mettle \"whose face still speaks volumes even as its frozen in the shape of a skull\".<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/comics/best-shots-comic-reviews-110606.html</ref> In his review of ''Avengers Academy'' #20, Pepose called [[Tom Raney]]'s depiction of the \"still-faced\" Mettle \"absolutely heartbreaking\".<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/comics/best-shots-comic-reviews-111031.html</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Avengers Academy}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2010]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
