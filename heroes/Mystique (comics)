Retrieved October 23, 2008.</ref> is a fictional character who appears in American comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]], as well as in a number of movie, television, and video game adaptations, typically in fiction related to the [[X-Men]]. Created by artist [[David Cockrum]] and writer [[Chris Claremont]], she first appeared in the comic book ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' #16, published in 1978.<ref name=debut>''Ms. Marvel'', No.16 (April 1978)</ref>\n\nMystique is a member of a fictional subspecies of humanity known as \"[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]\", who are born with superhuman abilities.  Mystique is a shapeshifter who can mimic the appearance and voice of any person with exquisite precision. She is typically a villain and foe of the [[X-Men]].\n\n==Publication history==\nMystique was created by artist David Cockrum. Chris Claremont saw Cockrum's design, dubbed the character \"Mystique\", and, with Cockrum's permission, set her in ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' No.16 (May 1978).<ref>[http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=7711 CHRIS CLAREMONT, UNTIL THE BITTER END] Protein Wisdom.

Art by Mark Texeira.]] -->\n\nRaven adopts the identity of deceased German secret agent Leni Zauber. Both Leni and Victor Creed, a.k.a. [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], had been assigned with the assassination of a scientist in East Berlin. Raven completes the mission in place of Leni, and then she and Victor have to hide in a safe location for a while. They become lovers, but she soon fakes her death in order to leave him.<ref>''Sabretooth'' #3</ref>\n\nThe result of this short-lived affair is reportedly the birth of [[Graydon Creed]]. A number of stories report that soon after his birth, Raven gives him up for adoption. Others depict Mystique making arrangements for him from a distance. Raven keeps track of his activities until he reaches adolescence. Despite being the child of two mutants, Graydon is not a mutant himself. Raven is disappointed and soon abandons him. Graydon grows to hate his parents, and eventually extends his hatred to all mutants. He later becomes leader of the mutant-hating organization [[Friends of Humanity]], and then a politician. Graydon, at the height of his political ascension, is assassinated by an unknown shooter.<ref>''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #130</ref> The shooter is later revealed to be a time traveling version of Mystique, as part of a convoluted time paradox involving [[Jean Grey]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>''X-Men Forever'' (2001 series) #2</ref>\n\n===Nightcrawler===\nRaven is married to [[Baron]] Christian Wagner; older sources give his name as [[Count]] Eric Wagner, an affluent member of the German [[nobility]]. He proves to be a loving husband, but disappointing as a lover. His [[infertility]] adds to their marital problems. Raven starts using her shapeshifting powers in order to secretly have sexual encounters with others. She is eventually seduced by fellow mutant [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]]. Azazel states that he is ruler of \"an island nation off the coast of [[Bermuda]]: La Isla des Demonas,\" The Island of [[Demon]]s.{{issue|date=December 2014}} He is later revealed to also have the power of [[immortality]] and to be the father of an ancient race of mutants known as the [[Neyaphem]], active since at least 2000 BC.{{issue|date=December 2014}}\n\nRaven becomes pregnant. Her husband becomes suspicious and his own father suggests a blood test to verify whether the child is his. Mystique uses a dagger to murder him and then buries him. She gives birth to a young boy with black hair, yellow eyes, blue skin, and a pointed tail. The locals consider the mother and child to be demons, and attempt to kill them. Mystique escapes but abandons her son. He is found and raised by [[Romani people|Gypsy]] sorceress [[Margali Szardos]] and named [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]].{{issue|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Rogue===\nMystique later becomes the adoptive mother of the four-year-old girl [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]].  Rogue had run away from her home in rural Caldecott County, [[Mississippi]]. The girl was living alone in a wooded area, brandishing a shotgun and trusting no one, when Mystique found her. Destiny foresees that Rogue will be important to them and Mystique seeks her out, gains her trust, and takes her in. She and Destiny raise the girl, and Mystique grows to be very protective of her.\n\nMystique, as Raven Darkh\u00f6lme, rises rapidly through the United States Civil Service to the trusted position of Deputy Director of the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) in the [[United States Department of Defense]]. This position gives her access to military secrets and advanced weaponry, both of which she uses for her own criminal and subversive purposes. In this position, she attempts the theft of the Centurion weaponry from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #17</ref> She also beat [[Ms. Marvel]]'s lover Michael Barnett to death, and sought to kill Ms. Marvel.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes'' Vol. 2 #11</ref>\n\nTo help her in her criminal activities, Mystique organizes her own incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], consisting of herself, [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], Destiny, and [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]]. The Brotherhood attempts to assassinate Senator [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]], a notoriously anti-mutant politician. The X-Men thwart the assassination attempt, and all of the Brotherhood save Mystique herself are incarcerated.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #141\u2013142 (January-February 1981)</ref>\n\nRogue is trained by Mystique and eventually joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Her mutant power is the ability to absorb the memories, personality, and skills or powers of whomever she touches. To free the other members of the Brotherhood, Mystique concocts a plan involving Rogue absorbing the powers of Ms. Marvel and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Though the plan is successful, the Avengers ultimately defeat the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, capturing all of them except Rogue and Mystique. Moreover, Rogue finds that she has absorbed Ms. Marvel's memories, personality, and powers permanently.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #10 (1981)</ref> In a further humiliation, a confrontation at the Pentagon ends with Mystique being defeated and turned over to the authorities by a powerless Ms. Marvel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #158 (June 1982)</ref>\n\nThe Brotherhood of Evil Mutants eventually escape, and battle against [[Dazzler]].<ref>''Dazzler'' #22\u201323 (December 1982-January 1983)</ref> However, in an act of revenge against Mystique, [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] unbalances Rogue's psyche with the one she absorbed from Ms. Marvel, which prompts her to defect to the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #170\u2013171 (June-July 1983)</ref> Because Rogue left without a word, Mystique assumes that [[Professor X]], the X-Men's mentor, brainwashed her. The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants accordingly launches an attempt to kill Professor X. However, Rogue stops Mystique, and explains that she joined the X-Men because Professor X, as the world's most powerful [[telepath]], is her best hope of healing for her fragmented psyche. Mystique reluctantly relinquishes her guardianship of Rogue.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #177\u2013178 (January-February 1984)</ref>\n\n===Freedom Force===\nLater, anti-mutant sentiment rises and the federal government launches its own covert anti-mutant program, [[Project Wideawake]]. Believing that the times have become too dangerous for the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to continue, Mystique goes to Doctor [[Valerie Cooper]], special assistant to the head of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and offers the Brotherhood's services to the government. In return for entering government service, Mystique and her team receive a presidential [[pardon]] for all criminal charges, to be revoked if any member of Freedom Force is found committing a crime. Cooper agrees to convey the offer to the President on the condition that the Brotherhood arrests their founder, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. The Brotherhood, now reincarnated as [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], are defeated by Magneto and the X-Men. However, when Magneto learns that Freedom Force are official federal agents, he voluntarily surrenders to them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #199</ref>\n\nMystique leads Freedom Force in capturing the Avengers on behalf of the federal government.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #15; ''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #1</ref> She clashes with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] in seeking to arrest [[Rusty Collins]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #8\u201310</ref> With Freedom Force, she fights the X-Men in Dallas, and witnesses [[Fall of the Mutants|her foster daughter's apparent demise]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #223\u2013227</ref> With Freedom Force, she battles [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #40</ref> With Freedom Force she seeks to arrest Rusty Collins again, and battles the [[New Mutants]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #78</ref> She finally succeeds in capturing Collins as well as [[Skids (comics)|Skids]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #80, 82</ref> She leads Freedom Force against the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] on [[Muir Island]]. On this particularly disastrous mission, Freedom Force loses two of its members, [[Stonewall (comics)|Stonewall]] and Mystique's lover Destiny.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #254\u2013255</ref> The death of her lover leaves Mystique psychologically scarred.\n\nMystique is later nearly killed by Dr. Valerie Cooper, who is under the [[Shadow King]]'s mental control.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #266</ref> She then impersonates Dr. Valerie Cooper.<ref>''X-Factor'' #60</ref> Mystique is eventually discovered impersonating Dr. Cooper, and saves Xavier's life by killing the Shadow King's human host, Jacob Reisz.<ref>''X-Factor'' #69</ref> She finally reconciles with Rogue.<ref>''X-Factor'' #70</ref> In time, she comes to terms with Destiny's death.<ref>''X-Factor Annual'' #6</ref> She teams with [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in thwarting [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]'s near-destruction of the universe.<ref>''Wolverine'' #51\u201353</ref> Mystique later briefly stays as a guest at [[X-Mansion|Xavier's mansion]]. She begins going insane, and leaves the mansion under the care of Forge.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #289\u2013290</ref>\n\n===X-Factor===\nMystique resurfaces several months later, in a failed attempt to kill [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] for his murdering of Destiny. Mystique has an implant put in her skull by [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] in order for the government to be able to keep track of her. She is then forced to become a member of the government-sponsored team [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] after being arrested for trying to blow up a dam. In truth, Mystique had been trying to save the dam, which the U.S. Government wanted to destroy so that they could blame it on mutants. Her membership leads to tension with her teammates when Sabretooth is added to the team months later as a [[sleeper agent]], for the main purpose of killing Mystique before she can uncover the truth about the conspiracy. She slowly develops a romantic relationship with team-leader Forge (though he later thought that she was just using him).{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nPart of the conspiracy involves Mystique's son Graydon Creed running for President, under an anti-mutant platform.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nAt the same time, both Graydon and Mystique learn that Destiny married and had children during one of the couple's separations. Irene's children are now adults with their own children, one of which is a mutant. Graydon has the mutant teen savagely beaten by members of the Friends of Humanity, as a warning towards his mother. Mystique is furious and wants to kill her son, but stops when she is given a message that Graydon's backers want her to kill him and turn her son into a martyr.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nMystique then seeks to save her son from being betrayed by his backers, but fails. Graydon's death ushers in a new wave of anti-mutant violence. Sabretooth acts on his orders to kill the members of X-Factor as \"Operation Zero Tolerance\" is activated. Mystique distracts Sabretooth long enough to keep him from finishing off the team. Mystique then flees the scene after arranging for X-Factor to receive medical treatment for the wounds Sabretooth inflicted.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nMystique goes into hiding, taking the identity of the senator's wife Mallory Brickman, using her husband's influence to set the FBI on Sabretooth. She prevents Rogue from giving up her mutant powers and continues her investigation of the U.S. Government over her son's death, leading to her aiding Toad and his most recent incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Toad's Brotherhood|Brotherhood of Mutants]] on a mission to raid a government base. The mission fails thanks to [[Machine Man]], who fights the Brotherhood and forces the team to flee. Mystique flees to Europe. While taking the form of a blonde haired woman, Mystique is confronted by a famous photographer who proposes to make her a big fashion model.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nAmused, Mystique accepts and quickly becomes the fashion industry's newest top model. Using her money, Mystique moves back to New York and into an expensive penthouse apartment. There, [[Skrull]]s staying in a nearby building frame Mystique for the murder of a Japanese diplomat. With help from Shadowcat and Rogue, Mystique is cleared and leaves town. Before she leaves, Shadowcat finds one of [[Destiny (Irene Adler)#The Books of Truth|Destiny's diaries]], left there by Destiny herself before she died.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Breakdown===\nWhile gaining critical intelligence on the identity of those who were involved in her son's death and the attempt to kill her using Sabretooth, Mystique suddenly loses her powers while pretending to be a man in a busy office workplace.{{issue|date=December 2014}}\n\nMystique is arrested. The U.S. Government acts on their intelligence regarding Mystique, and destroys all of the alternate identities that she established over the years and confiscate the money she and Destiny had hidden away. The loss of her powers and her freedom causes her to lash out at everyone around her. Rogue has no sympathy for Mystique's plight. The relationship sours when Rogue refuses to tell Mystique that the X-Men are going to fight the [[High Evolutionary]], who was responsible for depowering all mutants, in order to restore everyone's powers. The X-Men defeat the High Evolutionary and restore everyone's powers, allowing Mystique to escape jail.{{issue|date=December 2014}}\n\nMystique is later sent back in time by the original X-Factor's sentient ship. Raven finds that she is destined to be part of a great time paradox, where she finds herself with a time delay weapon, which she is about to program to kill Graydon. After some deliberation, she decides to activate the weapon to kill Graydon. Mystique's sanity is further damaged by the revelation that Destiny was one of the founding members of the anti-mutant conspiracy Mystique had dedicated countless years to fighting, and had willfully withheld medical treatment to mutant children that would have resulted in them not growing up deformed due to their mutations.{{issue|date=December 2014}}\n\nThis leads to Raven again going mad. She reforms the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants for another assassination attempt on Senator Kelly, and kidnaps [[Moira MacTaggert]] and impersonates her in order to access her research on the [[Legacy Virus]]. Mystique uses samples of the Legacy Virus to create a biological weapon that would infect humans and not mutants, and develops a cure for the Legacy Virus.{{issue|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe assassination attempt on Kelly ends in failure when Pyro betrays his teammates. Mystique blows up MacTaggert's research facility, fatally injuring the doctor. Mystique then shoots Moira's foster daughter Wolfsbane with a prototype of Forge's neutralizer gun, depowering her. The X-Men confront Mystique and she is seriously wounded. She tells the X-Men that Destiny had predicted a dark future for mutant-kind, and that the future Destiny foretold kept on unfolding despite all that Mystique had done to prevent it. She believes that the only way to save them is to eradicate all humans.{{issue|date=December 2014}}\n\nMystique is sent to prison, but quickly escapes. She allies herself with [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]] in an attempt to wrest control of the [[X-Corps]] from its founder, [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]. Outfitted with a device that gives her the ability to generate an electrical charge, Mystique creates the identity of a supervillain named Surge and joins the X-Corps. While Jason mind-controls the other members of the organization, Mystique brings Banshee's organization down and slits his throat, leaving him in critical condition.{{issue|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Double agent===\n[[Professor X]] is forced to make Mystique his secret agent, as his previous one, [[Prudence Leighton]], has died and Mystique is the only one suitable to complete the missions. Xavier poses as Magneto to rescue Mystique from the Department of Homeland Security and from execution at the hands of [[Johny Kitano]], Special Magistrate for Homo Superior crimes against humanity, and a mutant himself.<ref name=\"Mystique #2\">''Mystique'' #2</ref> At this time, Mystique claims that there is an imposter out to frame her, taking control over the Brotherhood and sending them on their recent missions (the assassination of Moira and the infiltration of X-Corps). As long as Mystique completes the missions without killing anybody, Xavier keeps her safe from the authorities, who are out to execute her. Working with Xavier is Forge.\n\nOne of Xavier's enemies, the Quiet Man, who is actually Prudence Leighton inhabiting the body of her assassin,<ref name=\"Mystique24\">''Mystique'' #24</ref> contacts Mystique and offers to give her an interference transmitter which would keep her safe from the authorities if she kills Xavier. Creating a plan that would free her from both men, Mystique pretends to try killing Xavier while secretly working with the mutant thief [[Fantomex]], after alerting Forge to stop her at the last moment. Her plan is to have the Quiet Man see this and believe that she really has attempted to kill Xavier and is still working for him. The other X-Men believe that Mystique has tried killing Xavier and seek her out.<ref name=\"Mystique #23\">''Mystique'' #23</ref>\n\nRogue tracks her down. Distraught with rage, she attacks her foster mother. Mystique escapes by blowing up the house and going through the window, changing her form to shield her fall.<ref name=\"Mystique #23\"/>\n\nMystique goes to the Quiet Man, who is planning on having her killed. After a battle, Mystique kills the Quiet Man, saves her former field-handler [[Shortpack]], and discovers the Quiet Man's interference transmitter was a fake. She tries to steal Forge's interference transmitter but is caught. After some angry words, he smashes it and tells her he never wants to see her again. The two share a sad goodbye kiss and Mystique leaves. After Mystique is gone, Forge realizes that she had already switched his transmitter for the fake one.<ref name=\"Mystique24\"/>\n\n===Joining the X-Men===\nMystique later infiltrates the X-Men, posing as a young girl named '''Foxx''' and joining [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'s training squad, the Chevaliers.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'', vol. 13 (2010)</ref> She attempts to seduce Rogue's boyfriend Gambit to break them up so she can set her daughter up with a young mutant named [[Pulse (X-Men)|Augustus]],<ref>''X-Men'' #171\u2013174</ref> but Gambit resists. Mystique ultimately reveals herself to him, telling him that she is trying to relieve the tension between him and Rogue (because of the two being unable to touch due to her ability to absorb someone's essence upon skin-to-skin contact). Mystique then metamorphoses into Rogue and tells Gambit that he would not be cheating on Rogue if he had sex with her in Rogue's form.<ref>''X-Men'' #172</ref>\n\nWhen the telepath [[Emma Frost]] discovers who Foxx really is, the X-Men confront Mystique. Mystique tells them that she had been lonely and wants to join the X-Men. Mystique uses Rogue's doubts about what happened between her and Gambit to sow further discord in Rogue's relationship with Gambit.<ref>''X-Men'' #173\u2013174</ref>\n\nThe X-Men vote and decide to have Mystique join them on a probationary status (though Rogue is one of the ones who vote against her joining). Nightcrawler asks her to leave for a while regardless of the vote, saying that he needs more time adjusting to the idea of her being a member. Mystique agrees and leaves.<ref>''X-Men'' #174</ref> After [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], she joins the [[X-Men]] and brings Augustus ([[Pulse (X-Men)|Pulse]]) along with her. Both have been crucial in the downfall of Apocalypse.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\n===Marauders===\nAfter the Hecatomb battle on Providence, [[Rogue (comics)#Endangered Species: Rogue's X-Men|Rogue's team]] returns to Rogue's childhood home in Caldecott County, Mississippi, which Mystique owns for some downtime. Mystique alerts the X-Men, who come to treat Rogue's illness, that there are intruders in the area. Only after [[Lady Mastermind]] drops her illusions do the X-Men realize that it is an all-out attack, and that both Lady Mastermind and [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]] (the latter being possessed by [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]]) have defected sides. During the Marauders' initial ambush, Mystique prevents [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]] from shooting Rogue. She then reveals herself as a traitor as well, shoots her adopted daughter, and orders the remaining [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] to kill the X-Men.\n\nMystique remains with the Marauders during the hunt for the first new mutant baby, but is revealed to have murdered [[Mister Sinister]] in a plot involving the baby and Rogue's killing touch. She also appears to be working with Gambit, who, like her, has ulterior motives to want to betray Mister Sinister. When Sinister approaches Mystique as she is with the comatose Rogue, Mystique shoves Sinister onto Rogue, killing him through fatal skin-to-skin contact. Then, in keeping with the words of the Destiny Diaries, she touches the baby's face to Rogue's. The baby's touch purges her of the Strain 88 virus and all the residual psyches she had absorbed over her life, including Hecatomb. However, Rogue is sickened by Mystique's manipulations, and leaves.\n\nWolverine tracks Mystique to the Middle East and then into Afghanistan.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol.3) #62</ref> It is hinted at that Mystique's recent betrayal is not the only reason Logan is out to kill her, as they have a common history of friendship, love, and ultimately, betrayal.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol.3) #63\u201365</ref> After a heated fight, Wolverine wounds Mystique, but denies her the [[Coup de gr\u00e2ce]].<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol.3) #65</ref>\n\n===''Manifest Destiny''===\nMystique shows up again, posing as Bobby Drake's ex-girlfriend Opal Tanaka. She sets off a bomb inside of Bobby's Blackbird before shooting him and kicking him out of the plane.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #1</ref> Later, she follows [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] to the hospital and injects him with a fatal dose of a toxin created by [[Mister Sinister]]. Hospital staff try to get to Iceman, but they are held back by Mystique while Iceman expels the toxin from his system. Afterward, Mystique attacks Iceman in a truck and sets the truck ablaze with Iceman in it. Iceman steps out of the fire unharmed and disarms and immobilizes Mystique, but she escapes after turning her body into her child form. Mystique impersonates Iceman and stands on top of the Golden Gate bridge threatening to blow it up. Iceman arrives and discovers the reason for Mystique doing this is [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] telling her that she will die alone. After a heated conversation, Iceman freezes the bomb. Mystique jumps off the bridge into the water. Iceman tells Cyclops and [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] that he knows that she is not dead and thanks her for what she did for him.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #5</ref>\n\n===Dark X-Men===\nMystique joins [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark X-Men]], posing as Professor Charles Xavier for [[public relations|P.R.]] purposes. Osborn has her injected with [[Nanorobotics|nanite]]s and kept on a short leash; should she try anything, Osborn would turn her into a human bomb.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #513</ref> After the defection of [[Emma Frost]], [[Namor]], and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], Mystique leads the remaining members of the team under the public guise of [[Jean Grey]], as no one could prove Jean had actually died, but mainly to hurt those who had caused her great harm.<ref>''Dark X-Men'' #1</ref>\n\nWolverine, having returned from hell and retrieved his possessed body from a demonic force, targets Mystique after finding out she was responsible for sending his soul there at the behest of The Red Right Hand.{{issue|date=February 2013}} Mystique is shot by a hit-man named Lord Deathstrike. Badly wounded, Mystique patches herself and escapes on a motorcycle. Wolverine & Lord Deathstrike are in hot pursuit of Mystique throughout the San Francisco streets simultaneously.{{issue|date=February 2013}} Mystique ultimately confronts Wolverine, who stabs her with his claws, killing her.{{issue|date=February 2013}} Lord Deathstrike collects Mystique's body and auctions it off. Her corpse is sold for 5 million to group of ninjas.

Mystique explains to her that she wants to buy Mardripoor from HYDRA and control the crime in the area. Before this transaction is completed, the X-Men raid the place.{{issue|date=July 2013}} Lady Mastermind and Mystique are captured,{{issue|date=July 2013}} but Mystique escapes in a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nMystique is attacked by Iceman, who is possessed by the Apocalypse fragment.{{issue|date=July 2013}} After Iceman is shattered into pieces by Thor, Mystique takes the Apocalypse fragment and swallows it to inherit its powers.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn order to help move her plans along, Mystique drugs and replaces Dazzler, who's now became SHIELD's mutant liaison, allowing her to set up her New Brotherhood under Maria Hill's nose.{{issue|date=February 2014}} She sets up operations in Madripoor, allowing her to regularly visit to 'investigate' the mutant uprising there, while secretly being the one in charge of it.{{issue|date=February 2014}} She offers Magneto a place in her New Brotherhood after he leaves the Uncanny X-Men team, but he rejects it on the grounds of her financing her operation via drug money from Mutant Growth Hormone sales, attacking and defeating her Brotherhood and stealing her chopper in order to find his own place in the new world.{{issue|date=February 2014}}\n\nMystique is a faculty member of The Hellfire Academy.{{issue|date=July 2013}} \n\n===Astonishing Avengers===\nMystique appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]] form.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2</ref> When the heroes and villains present undergo a moral inversion due to a flawed spell cast by the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Doctor Doom]],<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #4</ref> Mystique joins the other inverted villains in the 'Astonishing Avengers' as they go up against the inverted X-Men and Avengers,<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #6</ref> also working to prevent the inverted Nightcrawler from killing those who were involved in the riot that nearly killed him before his first meeting with Professor X.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' (vol.2) #14</ref> During the final fight, Mystique briefly poses as Professor X to try to get through to the 'reborn' Apocalypse (Actually the now-adult clone of Apocalypse known as Evan Sabahnur that the X-Men had been trying to raise away from his template's influence),<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #8</ref> but is converted back to her usual villainous attitude at the conclusion of the storyline.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMystique is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] with the ability to psionically shift the formation of her [[cell (biology)|biological cell]]s at will to change her appearance and thereby assume the form of other humans and animals.<ref name=\"Daken Dark Wolverine #3\">''Daken Dark Wolverine'' #3</ref><ref name=\"Astonishing X-Men #62\">''Astonishing X-Men'' #62</ref> She can also alter her voice to duplicate exactly that of another person. Originally, it was clearly stated that Mystique's powers were limited to appearances only; she could not assume the powers of the people she morphed into or alter her body to adapt to different situations. Additionally she could not change her overall body mass when taking on the appearance of a person larger or smaller, but thanks to subsequent enhancements she has stated that her body mass is not fixed and can change when she does.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #4</ref>\n\nHer body is not limited to purely organic appearances: She has the ability to create the appearance of clothes and other materials out of her own body, including items such as glasses, zippers, identity cards, handbags and even test tubes.  Mystique is shown in at least one instance transforming a metallic part of her costume into a functioning blaster pistol.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Whether this is a function of her powers or of the costume piece itself is unclear.\n\nAs a shape-shifter, Mystique is able to constantly alter and rejuvenate her body's cells and thereby retain her youthful appearance despite being alive for over one hundred years.\n\nMystique received her first power enhancement in the ''X-Men Forever'' miniseries, in which she was exposed to dangerous levels of radiation in order to save the life of [[Toad (comics)|Toad]]. The process boosted her powers so that she can now morph her body into taking certain desired physical traits depending on her situation at the time. Examples of these new abilities include [[night vision]], [[wing]]s on her back,<ref>''Wolverine'' v4 #9</ref> [[Claw|talons]] in her fingers, and natural body [[armour|armor]].<ref name=\"Daken Dark Wolverine #3\"/> She can compress into nearly two-dimensional like a sheet of paper to glide on air currents, similar to [[Mister Fantastic]], which she uses to survive an explosion.<ref name=\"Mystique #23\"/> She has moved her vital organs out of place in order to survive gunshots to her torso and head,<ref>''Wolverine'' #304''</ref> and can make herself virtually invisible via camouflage. She has even, with strain, given herself two heads and four arms to facilitate a gun fight on two fronts,<ref>''Mystique'' #5</ref> as well as shapeshifted into herself as a small child.<ref name=\"Mystique #2\"/> She is also now able to hold a shape when knocked unconscious<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #50</ref> and can conceal items in shapeshifted pouches under her skin.<ref>''Mystique'' #4</ref>\n\nFollowing her death and revival by the Hand, her powers have been further enhanced.<ref>''Wolverine'' #303</ref> She can now alter and conceal her scent from those with enhanced senses, and is capable of changing her shape to a greater degree, including altering her limbs to form tentacles and bladed weapons,<ref>''Wolverine & the X-Men'' #20</ref> and compressing herself into a dog.<ref name=\"Astonishing X-Men #62\"/>\n\nDamage to her biological tissue is known to heal at a relatively fast rate and she can form a resistance to [[poison]]s upon contracting them. Her enhancements have allowed her to rapidly regrow severed limbs,<ref>''Wolverine'' #12</ref> and rapidly recover from near fatal injury.  Her powers grant her immunity to diseases, enhanced agility and strength, and agelessness.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMystique is a cunning strategist in terrorist and commando operations, and adept at martial arts and information technology. She has a talent for finding, stealing, and understanding cutting edge weaponry. She is a talented actress and a polyglot, being fluent in over fourteen languages. Her mind is naturally unreadable owing to changing grey matter and she wears devices to prevent telepathic intrusion. Furthermore, with over a century's experience in posing as other people she has picked up the uncanny skill of being able to identify people posing as others based on [[body language]] and changes in behavioral cues.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Absorbed by Rogue===\nA copy of Mystique's mind, including her memories and personality, exists within the mind of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] ever since the events of \"[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]\". She converses with Rogue. She also requests that Rogue turn over control of their body. Eventually she is erased by Professor Xavier.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #224</ref>\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the Age of Apocalypse timeline, she gave up her adopted daughter Rogue to Magneto and his X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1 (1995)</ref> Years later, Mystique is the ferrywoman to Avalon. It is her task to meet the refugees and make sure they meet the guide to Avalon, [[Juggernaut (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Cain]]. Though she works against Apocalypse, she is not much of a hero. She charges a heavy tariff to ferry the refugees to Avalon, taking all of their valuables. This plagues her conscience and she is reluctant to go to Avalon, as she feels that she is not fit to enter. Ultimately, she gets past her guilt to guide her son, [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Nightcrawler]], to Avalon and find Destiny. She and her son form X-Calibre to defeat [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s agents, the [[Pale Riders]] and the Shadow King.<ref>''[[X-Calibre]]'' #2-4 (1995)</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Atom===\nMystique's future is shown, where she is revealed to be the mother of Charlie Xavier II, the son of [[Charles Xavier]], possessing his father's powers and appearance. While disguised as [[Moira MacTaggert]] she gives birth to Charlie, but upon birth she tearfully abandons her child. Later she raised her son Raze (conceived by Wolverine, with his mother's shape-shifting skills and his father's healing ability), who eventually killed her and took her appearance to rule Madripoor.<ref>''All New X-Men'' #27</ref>\n\n===Cable's Future===\nMystique inquires of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] \"How does [history] judge the part we play here and now in protecting the remnants of mutant-kind?\" He says \"History is short on specifics\" and that it only remembers broad movements, not individuals. She hints at wanting to know how she is remembered, and he comments that her name did survive in a database of his time. Her name is synonymous with traitor, comparing her name to [[Judas Iscariot]]. He adds that the information from his time is part of his history, as it was 2,000 years old.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #192</ref>\n\n===Exiles===\n[[Image:Exiles-Mystiq.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mystiq (Raphael-Raven Darkholme). Art by [[Tom Grummett|Tom Grummett.]]]]\n\nIn the Earth-797 reality, Mystique is apparently a man and goes by the name of Raphael-Raven Darkholme (and his alias is Mystiq). Much like the main Mystique, he has a relationship with Destiny but due to his gender has a child with her (Claremont's [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Family relations|original plan for Nightcrawler's origin]]). They are both killed in unknown circumstances and Raphael often goes to their grave sites. On such an occasion, he is about to be attacked by soldiers when the Exiles' Sabretooth, who had been stranded on this Earth, saves his life. Saying he is in his debt, he joins the Exiles when they come to pick up their teammate.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===House of M===\nIn the [[House of M]], Mystique is an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and a member of its elite unit, the Red Guard, alongside [[Veranke|Jessica Drew]],<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Jim Cheung]] | Inker = John Dell, Jay Leisten | Title = New Avengers | Issue = 45 | Date = November 2008 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Toad, and her children Rogue and Nightcrawler. She's also involved in an affair with Wolverine, the Red Guard's leader. When this unit, in pursuit of their former leader, attacks the heroes 'awakened' by [[Layla Miller]], the entire squad is restored. With all of reality against them, any personal history is set aside, and Mystique fights alongside the rest of the 'awakened' without incident.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Marvel Mangaverse===\nIn X-Men Mangaverse, Mystique teams up with Nightcrawler and other Brotherhood members. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] later kills her with a lightning bolt.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nMystique appears as a zombie twice in the Marvel Zombies universe. She is first shown disguised as [[Scarlet Witch]], in order to get close to and bite [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], thus becoming directly responsible for the fast spread of the zombie virus throughout the world. She is also shown fighting alongside zombie versions of [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Blob (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Blob]], and [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]] taking a direct blast from [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] right to the face.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Ultimate Mystique===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, Mystique is the former lover of [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Charles Xavier]]. During their stay in the Savage Land with Magneto, the young [[Emma Frost#Ultimate Emma Frost|Emma Frost]] comes under the tutelage of Xavier, and shortly thereafter he dumps Mystique for Frost.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #62</ref> Ever since then, Mystique has held great resentment toward Xavier, which in turn makes her loyal to Magneto.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #63-65</ref> She teams up with [[Forge (comics)#Ultimate Forge|Forge]] and helps [[Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]] escape the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] by taking his place in the prison cell,<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #65</ref> before she is replaced by [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)#Ultimate Mastermind|Mastermind]] and [[Stacy X#Other versions|Stacy X]] and given a new assignment. She is hinted to be one of the few who actually knows how Xavier's darker side operates, stating \"''We all bought into Xavier's dream until we got a look at the sick brain behind it.''\"<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #81</ref> It is later revealed that Emma Frost named Xavier's cat after Mystique, after the feline partially destroyed the decor of his office.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men Annual'' #2 (2006)</ref> She briefly appears in ''Ultimates 3'', impersonating the Black Widow to distract [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] until knocked out by the Wasp.<ref>''Ultimates 3'' #1-5</ref> She is later seen with the few surviving Brotherhood members still stationed in [[Wundagore]].<ref>''Ultimate X'' #1-5</ref>\n\n===X-Men: The End===\nIn the trilogy book series ''[[X-Men: The End]]'' Mystique is posing as Dark Beast and pretending to work with [[Mister Sinister]]. When Sinister murders Rogue she kills him. Gambit later asks her to look after his and Rogue's children when he goes off into space.<ref>''X-Men: The End (book two)'' #6</ref>\n\n===X-Men Fairy Tales===\nMystique appears briefly in the ''[[X-Men Fairy Tales]]'' limited series' first issue.

The other thieves are [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] and [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]]. In the fourth issue, she appears as Anna/[[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s mother, a voodoo priestess.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n==In other media==\n[[Image:Mystiquemovie.jpg|200k|thumb|right|[[Rebecca Romijn]] as Mystique in the X-Men films.]]\n[[Image:Jennifer-lawrence-mystique.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[Jennifer Lawrence]] portraying Mystique in the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'']]\n\n===Television===\n* Mystique [[recurring character|recurs]] in the 1992 ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series, voiced by Randall Carpenter in the first two seasons, and by [[Jennifer Dale]] for the rest of the show's run.

She appears as a follower of Magneto throughout the show's first season, and is featured sparingly in the second and third seasons before becoming a [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman of Apocalypse]] in the series finale.\n\n* Mystique appears in the episodes \"Greetings from Genosha\" and \"Battle Lines\" of the 2009 animated series ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', voiced by Tamara Bernier.

She is a member of Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. She reprises the role in the 2003 sequel, ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', where for most of the film she impersonates Sen. [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]], who Magneto killed in the previous film. She frees Magneto from the plastic cell he is being held in, and together they help the X-Men infiltrate [[William Stryker]]'s base at Alkali Lake when they discover that he intends to use a duplicate [[Cerebro]] and a brainwashed Xavier to kill all mutants. Romijn reprises her role one more time in 2006's ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. Magneto frees her, alongside Juggernaut, Pyro, and the Multiple Man, from a moving prison van, but when she dives in front of a series of shots meant for Magneto, the mutant cure within the ammunition turns her into a normal human, and Magneto abandons her as she is no longer one of them. His scorn leads to her revealing the location of the Brotherhood to the U.S. government.\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] portrays a younger Mystique in the 2011 prequel ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''. [[Morgan Lily]] briefly plays Mystique as a child while Rebecca Romijn makes a cameo as a transformation Mystique takes to seduce Magneto.<ref>{{cite news | last = Wells | first = Jeffrey | url = http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/2010/10/lawrence_on_the.php | title = Lawrence on the Line | publisher = Hollywood elsewhere | date = 2010-10-24 | accessdate = 2010-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dorn|first=Alex|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/motion-captured/posts/oliver-platt-will-be-man-in-black-in-x-men-first-class|title=Oliver Platt will be The Man In Black in 'X-Men: First Class'|publisher=HitFix.com|accessdate=August 17, 2010|date=August 16, 2010}}</ref> She is raised as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]'s foster sister, and helps found the X-Men, but eventually defects to Magneto as she is dissatisfied with Xaiver's constant attempts to ask her to hide where Magneto encouraged her not to fear her true appearance.

Mystique was subsequently captured and experimented upon, leading to the Sentinels' unstoppable shapeshifting abilities and a dystopian future. The film revolves around Wolverine's attempts to stop her assassination of Trask and avert the dark future after he is sent back in time by [[Kitty Pryde]] projecting him into his younger self. The group stops Mystique's attempt to kill Trask, but the altercation exposes mutants to the world for the first time earlier than in the previous timeline, prompting President Nixon to approve the Sentinel program while Trask studies a blood sample Mystique left behind during the attack. While Trask Industries ships the Sentinels to Washington, D.C. for their national presentation, Magneto secretly surrounds the Sentinels in steel, allowing him to control them. He subsequently commandeers the Sentinels to attack the crowd and hold off Wolverine, Xavier, and McCoy, but before he can kill what he believes to be Nixon (really a disguised Mystique), McCoy suppresses his mutation with a serum causing a Sentinel to turn on Magneto. Magneto quickly disables it, but the distraction allows Mystique to shoot him with a plastic gun, wounding him and releasing his control of the Sentinels. After Xavier convinces Mystique to let Trask, Nixon, and his cabinet live, the world sees that a mutant saved the President and the Sentinel program is shut down. Trask is arrested for selling military secrets to foreign powers, erasing the dystopian future seen earlier in the film. Mystique remains a rogue agent, disguising herself as [[William Stryker]] to retrieve Wolverine from the Potomac River. Lawrence will be reprising her role as Mystique in ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/04/11/x-men-apocalypse-new-details/|title='X-Men: Apocalypse': Who will return?
