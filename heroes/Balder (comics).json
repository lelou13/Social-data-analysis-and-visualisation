When the Chaos War at long last nears Earth, the Council summons Hercules, Amadeus Cho and Delphyne Gorgon before them and command them to bow before their authority; in return, the newly restored and empowered Hercules fights and easily bests most of them, including Balder himself with a single rage-fueled blow.<ref name=\\"chaosw1\\">\'\'Chaos War\'\' #1 (Dec. 2010)</ref>\\n\\nAfter the Underworld is overthrown by Mikaboshi and Hela and Pluto are overwhelmed by his devastating forces, Balder calls for the Council to fight alongside him against the Chaos King, only for the Japanese sun goddess Amaterasu to seal the throne room of the Celestial Axis, the latter claiming that if he went now, Mikaboshi would be able to trace him back to the Axis and subsequently invade all their realms, but promising that they will aid Hercules and Thor in their \\"own time\\". However, Mikaboshi breaks into the Celestial Axis after Hercules pierced the veil shielding it, and launches an assault on all of Earth\'s pantheons, seemingly decimating all of them with brutal ease and slaughtering many of the deities, although Balder is one of the survivors and later encounters Hercules.<ref name=\\"chaosw34\\">\'\'Chaos War\'\' #3-4 (Jan. - Feb. 2011)</ref>\\n\\n==Genealogy==\\n{{Thor family tree}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nBalder is said to be the fastest and most agile of all Asgardian warriors, with his speed being rivaled only by Hermod.

He is immune to all Earthly diseases and has some resistance to magic. Courtesy of a spell cast by his mother and Asgardian goddess [[Frigga (Marvel Comics)|Frigga]] to try to avert Ragnar\\u00f6k, Balder is almost totally invulnerable while within the Asgardian dimension, unable to suffer harm from virtually any living or non-living being.<ref name=\\"jim106107\\">\'\'Journey into Mystery\'\' #106-107 (July - Aug. 1964)</ref> Any projectile hurled at Balder which is capable of killing or injuring an Asgardian is magically deflected from its path before it can strike him; however, he can be injured or killed by weapons made of mistletoe wood, or if he wills himself to be vulnerable.<ref name=\\"thor305\\">\'\'Thor\'\' #305 (Mar. 1981)</ref> Balder could also die in the Asgardian dimension through means that do not involve weaponry: for example, he could starve to death or be asphyxiated; presumably he can also be harmed by the power of Odin, and possibly by spells and magical energies used by others.
