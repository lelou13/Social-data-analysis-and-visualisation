Her first appearance was in \'\'[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]\'\', vol. 2 #171.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nRoxy Washington is the daughter of a celebrity couple Roy \\"Daddy Libido\\" Washington and Angel \\"Sexy Mutha\\" Depres, who are purportedly both popular [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Appearing in her parents\' rap videos from a young age, Washington was often targeted by would-be kidnappers and assassins.\\n\\nDetermined not to follow in her parents\' footsteps, Washington turns her back on the music industry as a teenager and enrolls as a student at the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]] under the tutelage of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]. At the Institute, Washington carries a strong academic record and responsibility, and is more interested in improving herself and her mutant abilities rather than participating in the social conflict between humans and mutants, of which the X-Men are typically involved.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\\n\\n===Gambit\'s squad===\\nAs a member of Gambit\'s squad, the Chevaliers,<ref>\'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z\'\', vol. 13 (2010)</ref> Washington is forced to deal with the arrival of a new student, Foxx, and her infatuation with their squad instructor, despite being attracted to Foxx herself, indicating that Bling! is [[bisexual]] (confirmed in the \'\'X-Men: The 198 Files\'\' handbook) Bling!\'s attraction toward Foxx ends after Foxx is revealed to be the shapeshifting [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], attempting to sabotage Gambit and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]\'s relationship.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\\n\\n===M-Day and beyond===\\nBling! retained her powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], an event in which the [[Scarlet Witch]] casts a magic spell depowering over 90 percent of the mutant population. She later assists [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]\'s squad when [[Office of National Emergency|O*N*E]], a squad of government-run [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] arrive to protect the remaining mutant population seeking refuge at the Institute. She is also called upon to assist the senior X-Men teams when [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] returns, particularly due to a lack of senior X-Men at the time. Despite being highly recommended by Rogue and Havok and having been offered a position on the [[New X-Men]] squad, Roxy reveals that although she has a knack for field missions, she is intimidated by the idea of being a full-time X-Team member, feeling uneasy about the danger involved. She also contemplated leaving the institute with fellow student [[Onyxx (comics)|Onyxx]] for fear that the O*N*E* will soon be ordered to turn the school grounds into a mutant [[internment camp]].<ref>\'\'New X-Men,\'\' vol. 2 #35</ref>\\n\\nHowever, Roxy and Onyxx stay at the institute.

After it reappears behind her, she\'s pulled in where she is greeted by Emplate, who claims dinner is served.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy Annual\'\' #1 (2009)</ref>\\n\\nAfter being held as his prisoner, Roxy attempts to fight back against him only to fail until Rogue shows up to save her.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #229</ref> After a long battle that destroys his home and briefly anchors him to the X-Men\'s plane of existence, they drive him away.
