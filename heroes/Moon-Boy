He is best known as the constant companion of the red tyrannosaurus-like creature known as [[Devil Dinosaur]].\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nBeing primarily a supporting character to Devil Dinosaur, Moon-Boy has yet to be the lead character in a comic book series of his own.  His appearances in print have been invariably linked to the appearances of Devil Dinosaur. Moon-Boy made his debut in \'\'Devil Dinosaur\'\' #1 (April 1978) and was a continuing character in all nine issues of the series\' run. Since the cancellation of the original \'\'Devil Dinosaur\'\' series, Moon-Boy\'s appearances have coincided with Devil Dinosaur\'s various cameo appearances, supporting roles, and [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot comics]].\\n\\nThe team of Devil Dinosaur and Moon-Boy was created by artist Jack Kirby who scripted and penciled all issues of the first \'\'Devil Dinosaur\'\' series.  Kirby\'s intent was for the duo to be inhabitants of Earth\'s prehistoric past as evidenced by a title on the cover of \'\'Devil Dinosaur\'\' #1 which proclaims Moon-Boy to be the \\"first human.\\" Some later writers of the characters [[retconned]] the pair to be mutants from an alien world, while more recent writers have written them as being from Dinosaur World (Earth-78411), a planet located in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] contained within the [[Marvel Multiverse]].<ref>\'\'Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone and the Monster Hunters\'\' #1 (November 2005)</ref>  The main continuity in the Marvel Multiverse where Kirby intended the pair to originate from is sometimes referred to as \\"[[Earth-616]].\\"\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nMoon-Boy was born into a tribe of intelligent, fur-covered, ape-like humanoids known as the \\"[[Small-Folk]]\\".  The Small-Folk were hunter-gatherers that made their home in the \\"[[Valley of Flame]]\\", a region of numerous active volcanoes. Moon-Boy\'s connection with Devil Dinosaur began as a young boy when he came across a female dinosaur being attacked by a rival tribe known as the \\"[[Killer-Folk]]\\". The female was killed, as well as two of her three young. The third did not die however, but was transformed when the Killer-Folk attempted to burn him to death with their torches. The fire permanently scorched the young dinosaur\'s skin bright red.  Moon-Boy cared for the orphaned creature after its ordeal and named him \\"Devil\\".\\n\\nOstracized from his tribe because of his association with Devil, Moon-Boy and his red companion became wanderers.<ref>\'\'Devil Dinosaur\'\' #1 (April 1978)</ref> Devil and Moon-Boy\'s wanderings eventually took them to distant times and worlds. First, they encountered extraterrestrials.<ref>\'\'Devil Dinosaur\'\' #4-6</ref> Next they encountered [[Godzilla (comics)|Godzilla]], who had been transported to Moonboy and Devil Dinosaur\'s alternate Earth.<ref>\'\'Godzilla\'\' #21-22</ref> In time, they encountered the [[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]].<ref>\'\'Fallen Angels\'\' #4</ref> They traveled to Earth, and temporarily took up residence with the Fallen Angels in New York City.<ref>\'\'Fallen Angels\'\' #5</ref> After several trips to the modern era of Earth-616 via magic, time travel, and [[teleportation]] by mutants, the pair eventually settled in the [[Savage Land]] of Earth-616.<ref>\'\'Devil Dinosaur\'\' #9 (December 1978), \'\'Fallen Angels\'\' #4-8 (April - November 1987), \'\'Marvel Comics Presents\'\' #161 (August 1994), \'\'Marvel Comics Presents\'\' #174 (February 1995), \'\'Ghost Rider\'\' Vol. 3 #81-82 (January \\u2013 February 1997), \'\'Amazing Spider-Man Annual 1998\'\'</ref>\\n\\nWhile residing in the Savage Land, the forgotten world was invaded by the power hungry [[Roxxon Oil Company]]. [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]], ruler of the Savage Land, recruited Moon-Boy and Devil Dinosaur to help fight off the invasion, and Moon-Boy proved his worth as fighter during the following war.<ref>\'\'Marvel Comics Presents\'\' vol. 2 #5 (January 2008)</ref>\\n\\nLater, Moon-Boy became separated from Devil when he was removed from the Savage Land and taken to New York City by the [[Heroes for Hire]] mercenary team who were hired by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] scientists to retrieve the \\"\'\'[[Homo habilis]]\'\'\\" so that they might study his [[DNA]].<ref>\'\'Heroes for Hire\'\' #9-11 (April - June 2007)</ref>\\n\\nMoon-Boy would remain under the custody of S.H.I.E.L.D. for some time, which drove Devil into a sort of saurian depression causing him to refuse to hunt or even to eat food given to him. This came to the attention of [[Stegron]], the dinosaur man, who feared for the life of the beast, and left the Savage Land secretly to wage war upon S.H.I.E.L.D. Using an army of reanimated dinosaurs, Stegron attacked base after base searching for Moon-Boy, and was only stopped by the [[Fifty State Initiative]]. However, once learning the motive behind Stegron\'s attacks, the Initiative recruit [[Reptil]], smuggled Moon-Boy out of the country and returned him to the Savage Land, where he was reunited with his companion.<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nMoon-Boy has lifelong experience at foraging and general survival in the wild. He is somehow able to understand the guttural noises of his companion Devil Dinosaur as language.  Moon-Boy has little experience with civilized culture and/or behavior. He is extremely hairy, with thick fur covering all but his palms, soles, and face. Moon-Boy often goes about unclothed; his thick pelt of animal-like hair provides sufficient protection from the elements.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===Earth X===\\nIn the alternate universe, Earth-9997, of the [[Earth X]] series, Moon-Boy\'s skeleton is seen on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] atop the skeleton of Devil Dinosaur and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is revealed to be a descendant of Moon-Boy.<ref>\'\'Earth X\'\' #0 (March 1999), \'\'Paradise X\'\' #4, (September 2002)</ref>\\n\\n===Mutant X===\\nIn the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] series alternate universe, \\"[[Moon Knight]] Boy\\" is a member of Earth-1298\'s version of the [[Lethal Legion]].<ref>\'\'Mutant X Annual 2001\'\'</ref>\\n\\n===Nextwave===\\nIn the \'\'[[Nextwave]]\'\' series, which in 2006 was declared by Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] to be set in a universe separate from the main Marvel continuity,<ref>Wade Gum (2006-07-01). \\"Heros Con: Joe Quesada Panel\\", http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/000765389.cfm</ref> Devil Dinosaur is revealed to be the head of two organizations with ties to terrorism, the [[Beyond Corporation\\u00a9]] and [[S.I.L.E.N.T.]], both of which he created due to his growing hatred of \\"monkeys\\".

Moon-Boy tasted bad and gave me considerable rectal distress.\\"<ref>\'\'Nextwave\'\' #12 (March 2007)</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Television===\\n* Moon-Boy appears in \'\'[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]\'\' episode \\"The Devil Dinosaur You Say!\\", voiced by [[Josh Keaton]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\\n\\n== References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.toonopedia.com/devil_d.htm Toonpedia.com]\\n* [http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/oddball/index.cgi?date=2003-10-15 www.comicbookresources.com]\\n* [http://www.thefifthbranch.com/gorilladaze/?cat=4 Gorilla Daze]\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1978]]\\n[[Category:Fictional prehistoric characters]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Gorilla characters in comics]]"}]}}}}'
