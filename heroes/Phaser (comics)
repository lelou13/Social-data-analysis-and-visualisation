When [[Cassandra Nova]] makes her second attack on the school, Radian and other students, even knowing how dangerous Nova was, want to face her.

During the riot, Radian and other members of the gang confront several X-Men on the mansion\'s front lawn. Radian is stopped by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], who breaks his leg with his optic blasts. Afterwards, Radian, along with [[Redneck (comics)|Redneck]] and [[Tattoo (comics)|Tattoo]], are sent to a jail, run by humans. Wolverine informs him that he and the others would be sent overseas to do charity work after they completed their jail time.

However, on one of the team\'s first missions out to stop the Zodiac, she got too cocky when fighting Cancer, and was brutally killed in front of the rest of the team. He is currently in mourning over her death, and now has to deal with the deaths of Ripcord and Skybolt.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nBefore he was depowered on M-Day, Radian had the superhuman ability to generate blinding flashes of ultraviolet light from his body. Radian could control the intensity of these bursts, choosing to either blind or burn his opponents.\\n\\nAs Phaser, Christian can generate intense bursts of energy from the chest of his armor as well as deflect energy through specialized gauntlets on his arms.  All New Warriors have up to five powers so he may have additional abilities yet to be shown on-panel.\\n\\n==Bibliography==\\n*\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #135-138\\n*\'\'X-Men: The Last Stand\'\' novelization\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2002]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Frank Quitely]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Grant Morrison]]\\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
