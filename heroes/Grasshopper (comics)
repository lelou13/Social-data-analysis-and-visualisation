No Grasshopper to date has survived past the issue in which they first appeared. The Grasshoppers are a simultaneous [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to and [[satire]] of stereotypical superheroes and Marvel's tendency towards animal-themed characters.  They are also a lampoon of the tendency of superhero team books to introduce new, hastily developed characters only to dramatically kill them off within a few issues. The complicated romantic troubles of the first Grasshopper recall many characters with similar [[subplot]]s ([[Spider-Man]], for instance), as does the unlikely family background of the second.\n\n==Doug Taggert==\n'''Grasshopper''' is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe who first appeared in the pages of the \"[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLA: Misassembled]]\" miniseries of 2005. The character was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Paul Pelletier]]. He was a member of the [[Great Lakes Avengers]] for 5.8 seconds.\n\n===Fictional character biography===\nAlthough first appearing when he joined in a [[fourth wall]] breaking out-of-continuity prequel presented by [[Squirrel Girl]],<ref>''[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLA]]'' #1</ref> he did not appear in continuity until the next issue.<ref>''GLA'' #2</ref>\n\nIt is revealed that Grasshopper is in fact Doug Taggert, an employee of [[Roxxon]] Oil who pines after fellow Roxxon researcher Cindy Shelton, who in turn only has eyes for the \"ever-gregarious Grasshopper\" (thus setting up a classic comic-book style [[love triangle]]). Later it is clarified that Grasshopper is \"part-time Roxxon security\" who does \"some super heroing on the side.\" Though it is never so stated, the implication is that Roxxon designed and built the gear which is the source of Grasshopper's powers. Soon Grasshopper meets up with the GLA as they both try to stop a robbery being committed by [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc's Brigade]]. During the course of the battle, Grasshopper agrees to join up with the GLA, and then almost immediately is killed by a [[Sai (weapon)|sai]] thrown by the supervillain [[Zaran]] after it passed through teammate [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]]. As team sidekick Monkey Joe comments off-panel, \"Five point eight seconds. A new record for shortest membership on ANY team.\"<ref>''GLA'' #2</ref>\n\nLater, Doug Taggert briefly appears in a [[limbo]]-like afterlife, hanging out with other deceased GLA'ers. Though not particularly cheery in demeanor, he didn't seem too upset about his unfortunate fate either.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #4</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nThe first Grasshopper's powers are derived entirely from a powered suit, metallic green in color and with an appearance reminiscent of his namesake. The suit's primary ability is that of a fantastic vertical leap, powered by long, robotic hindlegs. These legs can also deliver devastating kicks. Its secondary abilities include \"Insectroid Sensors\", which work as an early warning system, and Zoom Lenses, which provide long range sight. Voice activated commands can be used to initiate some of the suit's powers. A notable fault of the suit seems to be that, despite its stiff and sturdy appearance, it offers little to no armor protection to the wearer (thus allowing a simple hand-thrown weapon to pierce the head, normally one of the most heavily defended areas on a suit of armor). It is unknown whether Taggart's suit had the \"Maximum Jump\" ability his successor Neil Shelton (unfortunately) had while using the suit.\n\n===Significant Issues===\n*''GLA: Misassembled'' #2\n*''GLX-Mas Special'' #1 - (Shelton becomes the Grasshopper)\n\n==Neil Shelton==\n{{Superherobox|\nimage=<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Grasshopper2-marvel.jpg]] -->\n|caption=The Grasshopper's appearance in ''GLX-Mas Special'' #1 (December 2005).\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\n|character_name=Grasshopper II\n|real_name=Neil Shelton\n|species=Human\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLX-Mas Special]]'' #1 (December 2005)\n|creators=[[Dan Slott]]<br>[[Ty Templeton]]\n|alliance_color=background:#ffc0c0\n|alliances=[[Roxxon|Roxxon Corporation]]\n|aliases=The Ever-Gregarious Grasshopper\n|powers=Armored suit grants:<br>Superhuman leaping via robotic grasshopper legs<br>Maximum Jump<br>Insectroid Sensors<br>Zoom Lenses<br>Minimal protection from attacks\n|}}\n\nThe second '''Grasshopper''' is a [[fictional]], corporate [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe who first appeared in the pages of the ''GLX-Mas Special'' #1, a [[Marvel Comics]] title, in 2005.  The character was created by Dan Slott and artist [[Ty Templeton]], who based his design on [[Paul Pelletier]]'s design for the original Grasshopper.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIt was not made clear if he was a member of the Great Lakes X-Men (as the [[Great Lakes Avengers|GLA]] were called at the time) before he, like Doug Taggart, was killed in action.\n\n===Publication history===\nThis Grasshopper is a combined homage to [[Iron Man]] and [[Spider-Man]], borrowing many aspects of each's histories. Like Taggart before him, Shelton didn't live more than one issue.\n\n===Fictional character biography===\n'''Neil Shelton''' was a security guard for Roxxon who gained use of the Grasshopper suit some time after Doug Taggert's death. As the second Grasshopper, he used a [[powered armor]] similar to that of [[Iron Man]]. The suit's primary ability is that of a fantastic vertical leap, which is powered by robotic grasshopper legs. Its secondary abilities include Insectroid Sensors, which work as an early warning system, and Zoom Lenses, which provide long range sight. Voice activated commands can be used to initiate some of the suit's powers. \n\nWhile patrolling outside of Roxxon Labs on Christmas Day, Shelton defeated [[Killer Shrike]] (himself a former employee of Roxxon) during the villain's attempt to steal \"Project Z\". Dr. Cindy Shelton shows up to recover the \"Project Z\" device and, unaware that this is a new wearer of the suit, invites Grasshopper to dinner. Via thought balloon, Neil states that he is secretly Cindy's long lost brother and must deny her feelings. This revelation makes the previous Grasshopper/Cindy Shelton love triangle even more bizarre. To escape Cindy's amorous advances, Neil initiates a \"Maximum Jump\", rocketing heroically into the air. However, it is later revealed (when [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]], in his new role as an angel of death, shows up to pick up his spirit) that the jump propelled Grasshopper into space, killing him. His sacrifice was not completely in vain, as Grasshopper's body re-entered the Earth's atmosphere to become a beautiful Christmas [[meteor|shooting star]].<ref>''GLX-Mas Special'' #1</ref>\n\n===Significant Issues===\n*''GLX-Mas Special'' #1\n\n==\"The All-New Grasshopper\"==\n{{Superherobox|\nimage=<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Grasshopper3.jpg|225px]] -->\n|caption=Grasshopper meets his maker in the ''[[Deadpool]]/[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLI'' Summer Fun Spectacular]] (July 2006).\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\n|character_name=Grasshopper III\n|real_name=\n|species=Human\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Deadpool]]/[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLI]] Summer Fun Spectacular'' #1 (September 2007)\n|creators=[[Dan Slott]]<br>[[Kieron Dwyer]]\n|alliance_color=background:#ffc0c0\n|alliances=\n|aliases=The All-New Grasshopper\n|powers=Armored suit grants:<br>Superhuman leaping via robotic grasshopper legs<br>Maximum Jump<br>Insectroid Sensors<br>Zoom Lenses<br>Minimal protection from attacks\n|}}\n\nThe third '''Grasshopper''' is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe who first appeared in the pages of the ''[[Deadpool]]/[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLI]] Summer Fun Spectacular'' #1 in 2007.
