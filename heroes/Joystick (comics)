When she was much younger, her father, a gambler, taught her his philosophy to 'always have a card to play'. She then used this philosophy to great advantage when she helped a mobster rob her father to save her own life. Later, she was a student at the [[University of Arizona]], living a life she later considered to be a bore. After her sophomore year, something happened to change her, apparently resulting in her death; in her \"new life,\" she became determined to live life on the edge, and began taking extreme risks. She then disappeared for three years before reappearing as Joystick.<ref>''The Amazing Scarlet Spider'' #2 (1995)</ref>\n\nHer occupations include former director of marketing at Chi-Huan Associates and mercenary. She is a mutated human/technology user and has been a member of the [[Crimson Cowl]]'s [[Masters of Evil]]. Joystick was a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] which at the time also included [[Atlas (comics)|Atlas]], [[Blizzard (Donnie Gill)|Blizzard]], [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-IV]], Photon, [[Radioactive Man (Marvel Comics)|Radioactive Man]], [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], and [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nHer various enemies include [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc's]] Brigade (Batroc, Machete, Maximillian Zaran), [[Green Goblin]] ([[Phil Urich]]), [[Justin Hammer]], [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]], [[Kaine]], Shannon, [[Polestar (comics)|Polestar]], [[Rhino (comics)|the Rhino]], [[Spider-Man]]/[[Scarlet Spider]] ([[Ben Reilly]]), [[El Toro Negro]], and [[Tremolo (comics)|Tremolo]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nDuring her stint on the Thunderbolts team, her powers have grown. She is now fast enough to match the Speed Demon in hand-to-hand, and is described as being 'the living embodiment of action'. After turning on her teammates, she was subdued and was last seen in prison.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nJoystick is also thought to be a bisexual. During ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', The Thunderbolts took on a group of college kids that had stolen M.A.C.H. IV's old suits of armor. After hearing Radioactive Man reference that one of them was a woman, Joystick tries to open up the armor stating \"Buddha said it's a chick in here... Just wanted to see if she was cute...\"<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #103</ref>\n\nAt other times she has been flirtatious with her male teammates as well.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nJoystick apparently possesses superhuman strength sufficient to press roughly ten tons, speed, reflexes & reactions, agility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance roughly equivalent to that of [[Spider-Man]]. The source of these powers remains unknown. She also wears metal devices on her wrists, each of which generates a \"baton\" of coherent energy, powered by [[strontium]] chips. These batons can be swung or hurled with great concussive force, sufficient to damage concrete. In addition, by striking the batons against one another, Joystick can project a powerful concussive force beam at a target, and possesses wires to hack into computers within her gauntlets. Her costume formerly contained an explosive device which would be activated with a 2 minute countdown by the controllers of the Great Game. The mechanism of the devices is unknown, as is their exact composition.\n\n===Universal Wellspring===\nJoystick is a mutate like the [[Folding Circle]] as well as [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]], [[Midnight's Fire]], and [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]]. Her powers come from the '''[[Universal Wellspring]]'''.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #107</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Joystick Joystick] at Marvel.com\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/joystk.htm|Joystick}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1995]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Arizona]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
