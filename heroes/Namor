In the series ''Sub-Mariner'' vol. 2, #1\u20136 (Aug. 2007 \u2013 Jan. 2008), he discovers his long-lost son Kamar, who attempts to usurp the throne of Atlantis but is killed by the supervillain [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]].\n\nWhen the X-Men relocated to [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]] off the coast of San Francisco, Namor decided to assist them due to his sympathy with their status as outsiders. As a result, he sided with the X-Men during the subsequent [[Avengers vs. X-Men|war with the Avengers]] over the coming of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] to Earth, eventually becoming one of the 'Phoenix Five' when the Phoenix Force was fractured between himself, Cyclops, [[Emma Frost]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jason Aaron|Aaron, Jason]]; [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]; [[Ed Brubaker|Brubaker, Ed]]; [[Jonathan Hickman|Hickman, Jonathan]]; [[Matt Fraction|Fraction, Matt]]|penciller= [[John Romita, Jr.|Romita, Jr., John]]|inker= [[Scott Hanna|Hanna, Scott]]|story= Round 5|title= [[Avengers vs. X-Men]]|issue= 5|date= August 2012}}</ref> Captain America attempted to arrange a meeting of the Illuminati to talk with Namor, but the rest of the group left before Namor arrived, and Namor refused to stand down when Rogers tried to appeal to him.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= [[Mike Deodato|Deodato, Mike]]|inker= Deodato, Mike|title= [[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]|volume= 2|issue= 29|date= October 2012}}</ref> He was eventually defeated by a mass attack from the Avengers when he attacked [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]], becoming the first of the Phoenix Five to fall.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Aaron, Jason; Bendis, Brian Michael; Brubaker, Ed; Hickman, Jonathan; Fraction, Matt|penciller= [[Adam Kubert|Kubert, Adam]]|inker= [[John Dell|Dell, John]]|story= Round 8|title= Avengers vs. X-Men|issue= 8|date= September 2012}}</ref>\n\nHaving recovered his senses after his time as one of the Phoenix Five, Namor rejoins the Illuminati when Black Panther calls for their aid - [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] replacing the deceased Professor X - in dealing with an incursion event as an alternate universe threatens to collide with our own.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol.3 #6</ref> Although they were forced to destroy the other Earth to protect their own, the Illuminati resolved to continue protecting their Earth from such events, only for Namor to act against the other members when he detonated an anti-matter device to destroy another Earth when the others could not bring themselves to do it.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol.3 #21</ref> Believing that the Illuminati's morality was holding them back, Namor assembled a new Cabal to deal with the incursions,<ref>''New Avengers'' vol.3 #23</ref> but despite the team achieving legitimacy as Earth's protectors, Namor grew weary of the wholesale slaughter they carried out in the name of preserving their universe. Although he collaborated with the Illuminati in a plan to destroy the Cabal by trapping them on the next Earth to be destroyed, Black Panther and Black Bolt left him behind to die with the Cabal, disgusted at his earlier actions.<ref>''Avengers'' vol.5 #40</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{plot|date=October 2011}}\nBecause of his unusual genetic heritage, Namor is unique among both ordinary humans and Atlanteans; he is sometimes referred to as \"Marvel's first mutant,\" because, while the majority of his observed superhuman powers come from the fact that he's a hybrid of human and Atlantean DNA, his ability to fly can't be explained by either side (Atlanteans are an off-shoot of \"baseline\" humanity); though, in terms of in-continuity chronology, there were many mutants in existence before Namor. Namor possesses a fully amphibious physiology suited for extreme undersea pressures, superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, flight, and longevity. Namor has the ability to survive underwater for indefinite periods, and specially developed vision which gives him the ability to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean.\n\nBill Everett, in his first Sub-Mariner story, described the character as \"an ultra-man of the deep [who] lives on land and in the sea, flies in the air, [and] has the strength of a thousand [surface] men\". No other powers were mentioned. When the series was revived in 1954<!--issue #33 cover-dated April 1954-->, Namor lost his ankle wings and with them the power of flight; they, and his full strength, were restored in ''Sub-Mariner'' #38 (Feb. 1955), in which Everett additionally wrote a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] story, \"Wings on His Feet\", detailing their appearance on Namor at age 14. This story was twice reprinted during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #17 (Nov. 1968), and in the book ''Comix'' by [[Les Daniels]].\n\nNamor possesses wings on his ankles to which he attributes his power of flight. On occasions when they have been lost or badly damaged, he has experienced a loss of flying ability.  He could not fly as a child, and the power only manifested when the wings developed in adolescence.\n\nNamor has the ability to swim at superhuman speeds, even by Atlantean standards.\n\nNamor has greater longevity than a normal human being. He is well over 90 years old as he was born in 1920 in the Marvel timeline, but has the appearance of a male in his prime. His identity as a pre-World War II superhero is well-established, making him less subject to the [[floating timeline|sliding timescale]] of the Marvel universe.\n\nDuring Namor's original fight with the Human Torch in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #8 (June 1940, and the first fight between superheroes to appear in any media), Namor was able to forcibly expel water from his body to extinguish fires, although it proved useless against the Torch.<ref>''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #8 (June 1940)</ref>\n\nAfter he was revived yet again in the 1960s by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, Namor demonstrated powers of various sealife that had not been shown in earlier stories.  An editorial note in ''[[Marvel Tales]]'' #9 (July 1967), stated explicitly that \"nautical Namor has since lost his power to imitate the characteristics of fish...\" According to one of Sub-Mariner's scripters, Roy Thomas: \"As for Namor's electrical and other sea-creaturely powers. They were used in one or two stories in ''F.F.'' and the Human Torch series in ''Strange Tales'', then dropped \u2013 as one of Stan [Lee] and Jack [Kirby]s early (and quite forgivable) mistakes. The explanation, given in a reprint of a Torch/Namor bout a few years later, was that he had these powers only for a short time and then lost them.\"<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy|story= Okay, Axis, Here We Come! (text article)|title= The Invaders|issue= 35|date= December 1978}}</ref>\n\nIn all his incarnations, Namor possesses superhuman strength and, with the possible exceptions of [[Orka (comics)|Orka]] and [[Tyrak]] at their full sizes, is the strongest Atlantean ever known. The exact level of his strength is dependent upon his physical contact with water, in which he needn't be submerged. It has been shown as sufficient to effortlessly toss a water-filled ocean-liner, despite the underwater [[viscosity]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Christian Cooper|Cooper, Chris]]|penciller= [[Doug Wheatley|Wheatley, Doug]]|inker= Wheatley, Doug|story= Lifesblood|title= Hulk / Sub-Mariner '98 |issue= 1|date= 1998}}</ref> His strength diminishes slowly the longer he is out of contact with water, though an extended period on land does not result in his death, as it would for a typical Atlantean, and his power is retained in full as long as he keeps himself wet. Namor possesses superhuman stamina and resistance to injury due to his hybrid nature. Namor's strength level is such that he has held his own in hand-to-hand combat with beings as powerful as the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in the past.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Herb Trimpe|Trimpe, Herb]]|inker= Trimpe, Herb|story= A Clash of Titans|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 118|date= August 1969}}</ref>\n\nSome stories have mentioned that Namor has gills for breathing underwater, e.g., in ''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #5, Namor thinks \"this New York river water burns my gills and scalds my lungs\".<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Byrne, John|story= All the Rivers Burning!|title= Namor, the Sub-Mariner|issue= 5|date= August 1990}}</ref> and artists such as [[Salvador Larroca]] have drawn him with gill slits on either side of his neck.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/10988/ ''Namor''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> In ''The Sub-Mariner'' #18\u201322 (1969\u201370), beings from outer space surgically closed Namor's gills for a time, leaving him with the ability to breathe air but unable to breathe underwater. Other sources have stated that his lungs contain oxygen diffusing membranes that allow him to breathe underwater.\n\nDue to a unique aspect of his hybrid nature (not shared by [[Namorita]]), it was theorized that Namor is vulnerable to oxygen imbalances in his blood that trigger manic-depressive mood swings; he can prevent imbalances by regular immersion in water.\n\nNamor gives off a sense of charisma which most women tend to find captivating.  Many of the ladies that have entered his life made clear their attraction to his masculine, slightly alien personality in ways both subtle and blatant.  He reacts to such advances with gratitude tinged with a slight distance born of monarchical etiquette.\n\nNamor is a natural leader, trained by the royal family of Atlantis as befitting an heir to the throne.  He has historically led troops into battle with expert success.  His typical interpersonal behavior with both subject and friend borders on the aloof; this is more a sense of regal ''noblesse oblige'' rather than snobbishness.\n\nNamor was given possession of the [[Infinity Gems|Time Gem]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael; [[Brian Reed|Reed, Brian]]|penciller= [[Jim Cheung|Cheung, Jim]]|inker= [[Mark Morales (comics)|Morales, Mark]]|story= This...is an Infinity Gem|title= New Avengers: Illuminati|issue= 2|date= March 2007}}</ref> This gem allows the user total control over the past, present, and future. It allows time travel, can age and de-age beings, and can be used as a weapon by trapping enemies or entire worlds in unending loops of time. After the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] attempted to steal the Gems, Namor briefly helped Thor recover the Gem from the bottom of the ocean to prevent the Hood acquiring it, before being entrusted with the Power Gem as the Gems were divided amongst the new Illuminati \u2013 Steve Rogers replacing Black Bolt \u2013 once again.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Romita, Jr., John|inker= [[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]]|story= My name is Thanos|title= The Avengers|volume= 4|issue= 12|date= June 2011}}</ref>\n\nNamor was educated by the royal tutors of the Atlantean court, and speaks English, Atlantean, and Lemurian. He is a highly skilled business executive.\n\n===Formerly depicted abilities===\nIn ''The Fantastic Four'' #9 (Dec. 1962), Namor states, \"I have the powers of all the creatures who live beneath the sea! I can charge the very air with electricity \u2013 using the power of the electric eel!\"  In the same issue, \"the radar sense of the cave fish from the lowest depths of the sea\" enables him to sense the presence of Sue Storm when she is invisible. He uses \"the power to surround himself with electricity in the manner of an electric eel\" again in ''[[Strange Tales]]''  #107 (April 1963), and #125 (Oct. 1964); in the former he manifests the power to inflate his body like a puffer fish. These extra powers were ignored, when Marvel gave Namor his own feature beginning in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #70 (Aug. 1965).\n\nAnother ability unknown in the Golden Age and rarely displayed is his telepathic rapport with many forms of marine life. He had a limited empathic rapport with Namorita.  But, only as a result of being given one of her \"magic earrings\" (which has long-since disappeared).\n\nAn editorial note in ''[[Marvel Tales]]'' #9 (July 1967), which reprinted the story from ''Strange Tales'' #107, stated explicitly that \"nautical Namor has since lost his power to imitate the characteristics of fish...\"  His electrical abilities were seen out of comic continuity in 1991's ''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game]]''. Furthermore, Namor employed these \"lost\" powers semi-regularly in his 1990s series, under John Byrne's pen.\n\n==\"Marvel's First Mutant\"==\nMarvel has repeatedly identified Namor as \"Marvel's first mutant\", which is true with regard to the order in which the character appeared in print.  He is not the oldest mutant in the fictional [[Marvel Universe]] timeline. A number of mutants predate him, including [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] (active since at least 10,000 BC), [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] (born in the 30th century BC), [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] (born in the 12th century AD), [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] (late 19th century AD), [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] (dates of birth unknown, but known to have been active at the \"Dawn of the 20th century\"), the demonic mutant [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]], and a group of mutants known as the [[Externals]].\n\nIn ''X-Men'' #6<!-- W:MOS: vol. 1 not labeled, only subsequent volumes --> (July 1964), [[X-Men]] leader Professor Xavier and antagonist Magneto each suspect Namor is a mutant. Later writers in the 1960s and 1970s described him as a hybrid, not a mutant, in order to distinguish him from the mutant X-Men.<ref>As explained in the letters page of ''Sub-Mariner'' #31 (November 1970)</ref> When the series was revived in 1990, the series title logo carried the subtitle \"Marvel's first and mightiest mutant!\".\n\nNamor is actually a hybrid of Atlantean and human physiology, although he has principal characteristics that neither Atlanteans (''Homo mermanus'') nor humans (''Homo sapiens'') possess. These include his ability to fly, and possibly his durability and strength (which is several times that of an Atlantean).\n\nIn the first issue of the five part ''Illuminati'' miniseries, after being experimented on by the Skrulls, it was confirmed that Namor is not only an Atlantean/human hybrid but also a mutant.\n\n=== X-Men ===\nNamor has joined forces with the X-Men.<ref name=\"Tramountanas\" /> He claims to have done so out of respect for Scott Summers and because \"while there are some who would stand with the many against the few, Namor will never be among them\".<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Aaron, Jason; Bendis, Brian Michael; Brubaker, Ed; Hickman, Jonathan; Fraction, Matt|penciller= Romita, Jr., John|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Round 1|title= Avengers vs. X-Men|issue= 1|date= June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Enemies==\n* '''[[Attuma]]''' \u2013 Leader of the Atlantean barbarians, Attuma would threaten Atlantis repeatedly; conquering it on several occasions, and became Namor's nemesis.\n* '''[[Byrrah]]''' \u2013 Childhood friend and rival to Namor, Byrrah was Atlantean royalty that lost the throne to Namor and observed him as unfit for the position.
