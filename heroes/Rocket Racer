He returned in issues #182 and #183 in a battle against the [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]]. His origin was finally revealed in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #104.<ref>http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/apps/rocket_racer.html</ref>\n\nRocket Racer appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' in issue #21 (Jan 2012) and issue #26 (April 2012).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Robert Farrell===\nRobert Farrell, born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], was the eldest of seven children. He became responsible for his younger siblings when his mother Emma Johnson Farrell died. Robert was a scientific prodigy, and when he realized he couldn't earn enough to support his family, he turned to a life of crime as the '''Rocket Racer'''. He developed a super-powered skateboard which is propelled at great speed by small rockets and cybernetically controlled by a crude walkman-like device. He wore a weapon-equipped costume, including rocket-powered gloves which give him the ability to hit an opponent with a \"rocket-powered-punch.\"\n\nEarly in his career as a burglar, Rocket Racer encounters [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #172</ref>\n\nRocket Racer hires [[Tinkerer]] to redesign his skateboard. At one point he is hired by Jackson Weele to steal evidence that might incriminate him. Robert uses the evidence to blackmail Jackson. Weele wishes to commit suicide but Robert stops him. Even then, though, he mocks Weele, calling him ''Big Weele''. This is enough for Jackson to hire the villain the Tinkerer to create a literal '[[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]]', to chase Robert around town with. Spider-Man assists and Jackson seemingly falls to his death in the Hudson River.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #182-183</ref> Later, Rocket Racer was saved by Spider-Man from the Bounty Hunter.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #104</ref>\n\nRepeated defeats at the hands of Spider-Man and several brushes with the law, including a short jail sentence, convince Robert to reform.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He goes through a high school equivalency course and his extremely high marks gain him a scholarship to [[Empire State University]].<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | year = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 30\u201333  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> This doesn't go well as his first few days are full with combating the efforts of a hate-group on campus.

He did so, taking the name \"Troy\" and posing as Farrell's friend for months.  When Farrell finally showed him where he kept the gear, 'Troy' tied him up and stole it, pursuing Spider-Man with the intention of fighting him, only to be defeated when a random restaurant employee opened a door at just the right time for 'Troy' to run into the door and knock himself unconscious.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #13 (January 2000)</ref>\n\nThis Rocket Racer briefly joined [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]'s prison squad along with <!--Do not add a link to [[Big Ben (comics)]] as it is not the same character]]-->Big Ben and [[Hypno-Hustler]].{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nRobert Farrell has a gifted intellect, but no superhuman powers. He wears gauntlets furnished with explosive mini-rockets, and utilizes a cybernetically-controlled, rocket-powered magnetic skateboard, which he designed and was later redesigned by the [[Tinkerer]].\n\n==Other versions==\nOutside of mainstream Marvel continuity, he has appeared as a super-villain in ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]''.<ref>''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane'' #4 (May 2006)</ref> In another series Rocket Racer is a socially withdrawn patsy of the supervillain called 'The Tinkerer', and his rocket gear is simply used to showcase the man's technological genius to potential clients.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man'' #21 (January, 2007)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n[[File:Spidermanep32.jpg|thumb|right|Animated Rocket Racer on 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'']]\n* Rocket Racer appeared in [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Billy Atmore]]. This version is depicted as a teenager in a crime-ridden neighborhood who ends up helping Spider-Man. He only appears in the episode \"Rocket Racer\". Robert had great skill in gyro mechanisms due to working at the Science center taught by Peter Parker. He stole parts of his technology from the criminal mastermind behind the [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]] and used them to create a cybernetically controlled, rocket-powered magnetic skateboard which he travels with and can attain speeds of {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h}}. He can also scale walls. After Robert was thought to have stolen some jewels, he was chased by [[Spider-Man]]. Rocket Racer escaped but Spider-Man planted a tracer on him and found out his identity. A criminal leader, whose machines were stolen, created the Big Wheel, a giant wheel with lasers, missiles, and spikes that was able to roll onto buildings and higher grounds. Spider-Man and Rocket Racer were able to stop the Big Wheel when Rocket Racer had Spider-Man electrocute the Big Wheel with two electric wires. The criminal was arrested. This taught Robert that education, not crime, would help him in the world to overcome his problems. Later in the night when the criminals demanding protection money came, Spider-Man and Robert took care of them.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Rocket_Racer Rocket Racer] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/rocket_racer.html Rocket Racer's Profile at Spiderfan.org]\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/rocktracertroy.htm|Rocket Racer}}\n\n{{Spider-Man}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Len Wein]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ross Andru]]\n[[Category:Comic book sidekicks]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]"}]}}}}
