He soon proved his usefulness in dispatching a [[skirmish]] between the Professor and the local bully [[Unus the Untouchable]].

Freakshow regains his powers, but like the other mutants who have used the mist, it came with a price. For some time, he is unable to change out of his large, monstrous form.

Some time after, the effects of the mist wear off.{{issue|date=January 2011}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:freakshow action.jpg|thumbnail|left|185px|One example of Freakshow\'s forms]] -->\\nFreakshow is a megamorph with the ability to transform his body into a variety of monstrous forms with unique abilities (such as a [[dragon]] form capable of flight and fire breathing).
