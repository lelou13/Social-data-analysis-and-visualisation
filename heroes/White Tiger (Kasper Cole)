He has also adopted the moniker of the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. The character was created by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] and [[Dan Fraga]] and introduced in \'\'Black Panther\'\' (vol. 3) #50.\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nWith sales numbers declining on the third volume of \'\'Black Panther\'\', the decision was made to retool the series.<ref name=\\"Paint It Black\\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/103131572446388.htm|title=Paint It Black: Talking With The Black Panther Team: Interviews & Features Archive|author=Rafael, Erwin|date=|work=|publisher=ComicsBulletin.com|accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> The original character - T\'Challa T\'Chaka, the king of Wakanda - would be replaced with a new character impersonating the Black Panther, starting with issue #50.<ref name=\\"Black&White\\">{{cite web |url= http://phonogram.us/comics/panther/bw/index.htm|title= digital-priest.com: The Black Panther: Black & White|author= Priest, Christopher|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=28 September 2010 |authorlink= Christopher Priest (comics)}}</ref> According to writer Christopher Priest, this would be \'some guy who starts this gig, essentially, as a scam, but who evolves over the course of time to embrace and appreciate the rich heritage and culture of the Lord of the Wakandas\'.<ref name=\\"Black&White\\" />\\n\\nIn issue #50 of the \'\'Black Panther\'\', Kevin \\"Kasper\\" Cole makes his first appearance. He is an officer in the narcotics division of the New York Police Department\'s Organized Crime Control Bureau (OCCB), looking to be promoted to homicide detective. He lives with his mother Ruth and his pregnant girlfriend Gwen in a squalid apartment in Harlem. His father \\"Black\\" Jack is a former cop that has been imprisoned on the charge of corruption.\\n\\nThe character was pitched by Priest as a \'dark satire of Spider-Man\', in line with work he had done on DC Comics\' [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]], who functioned similarly as a \'dysfunctional Superman\'.<ref name=\\"White Tiger\\">{{cite web |url= http://phonogram.us/comics/crew/kasper.htm|title= digital-priest.com: The Crew: The White Tiger|author= Priest, Christopher|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=28 September 2010 |authorlink= Christopher Priest (comics)}}</ref> The character of Kasper Cole and his friends and family therefore take many cues from Peter Parker and his supporting cast, with Kasper\'s mother Ruth correlating with [[Aunt May]], his father Jack with [[Uncle Ben]] and his girlfriend Gwen with [[Gwen Stacy]].<ref name=\\"White Tiger\\" /> Priest also drew inspiration from the film \'\'[[Training Day]]\'\', as well as sitcom \'\'[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]\'\'.<ref name=\\"White Tiger\\" />\\n\\nThe first storyline, \\"Black and White\\", running in issues #50 to #56, focuses on Kasper\'s investigation into the ties between his boss Sal Anthony and the criminal 66 Bridges gang. Suspended from the police force, he adopts the mantle of the Black Panther - stealing the costume from his Sergeant Tork, an ally of the Panther - so that he can gather evidence. This brings him into conflict with Nigel \\"Triage\\" Blacque (who leads 66 Bridges) and the police department\'s Internal Affairs.\\n\\nDuring the course of the investigation, Kasper also comes into contact with the original Black Panther, as well as the Panther\'s antagonist and half-brother the White Wolf (Hunter). They both attempt to manipulate him to their needs. Christopher Priest has described \\"Black and White\\" as being \'about a war between The Black Panther (T\\u2019Challa) and the \\u201cwhite panther\\u201d (Hunter) over the soul of this young kid\'.<ref name=\\"Black&White\\" />\\n\\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=\\"[[Tom DeFalco]] once taught me that [[Spider-Man]]\'s motivation for being Spider-Man was to patrol the city looking for crimes so he could photograph himself in the act of stopping the crimes and sell the photos to Jameson to raise money to pay his rent which was always late.

He has also struck a deal with his corrupt boss, who will help him take down 66 Bridges if Kasper locates his kidnapped son. This search is key to the final \'\'Black Panther\'\' storyarc, \\"Ascension\\" (#59-62).\\n\\nIn order to find the child, Kasper makes a deal with T\'Challa\'s nemesis Erik Killmonger, the then rightful holder of the Black Panther mantle. Given a synthetic version of the herbs that grant the Black Panther his powers, Kasper gains the enhanced skills necessary to locate the child. The arc and the series concludes with Kasper becoming a White Tiger, a sort of acolyte to the Black Panther cult, although he remains in Harlem.\\n\\nBefore the final \'\'Black Panther\'\' arc was finished, Kasper Cole was already designated as one of the feature characters in the short-lived \'\'The Crew\'\' (2003\\u20132004, 7 issues). He makes his first regular appearance in issue #1 and as the new White Tiger in issue #2. His character provides narration (the only one to do so) for the second, fourth, (part of the) sixth and seventh (the final) issue. In the series, Kasper teams with James Rhodes ([[War Machine]]), Danny Vincente ([[Junta (comics)|Junta]]) and [[Josiah X]] in taking on Triage and the 66 Bridges Gang. While Kasper\'s relationship with the other characters is fraught with conflict, they nonetheless manage to defeat Triage.\\n\\nAfter the conclusion of \'\'The Crew\'\', there have been no appearances by Kasper Cole, although he is referenced in the \'\'Civil War: Battle Damage Report\'\' one-shot.<ref name=\\"civilwarbattledamage\\">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>\\n\\n==Appearance==\\n[[File:KasperCole.jpg|thumb|right|Kevin Cole (left) is a character of mixed heritage, African and Jewish.
