JJ is the grandson of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and the son of [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]. His costume bears some similarities to [[Henry Pym]]'s ''Yellowjacket'' suit.\n\n==Publication history==\nFirst appearing in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] comic book series, [[Spider-Girl (comic series)|Spider-Girl]], the Buzz went on to have his own limited series.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nJack Jameson, or JJ to his friends, accompanied his grandfather, J. Jonah Jameson, C.E.O. of Jameson Communications (publisher of the [[Daily Bugle]]) to a demonstration of ''Project Human Fly''. The project's goal was to create body armor that would grant the wearer superpowers. The staff of the project included Dr. Marla Jameson (Jonah's wife), [[biophysicist]] Dr. Sonja Jade and Robert Douglas, grandson of the late [[Joseph \"Robbie\" Robertson]]. It was then that JJ first met Buzz Bannon, a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] and the [[test pilot]] for the Human Fly [[armor]]. From that day on they were fast friends. While JJ and Buzz were in the gym, Buzz got a message that he needed to attend a meeting about the Human Fly project, but it was a trap.\n\nDr. Sonja Jade turned out to be a traitor who took Marla, Jonah Jameson and Buzz Bannon hostage and was stealing the project files and armor. While her minions went to retrieve the armor, JJ and Richie Robertson found out what was going on and triggered a fire alarm. Buzz used the distraction to overcome most of his guards, but he was shot in the abdomen during the fight, while Richie was beaten unconscious. Nevertheless, Buzz managed to get away and, joined by JJ, get to the armor.\n\nA few moments later, the Human Fly rescued the [[hostage]]s and went after the villains, but Dr. Jade got away due to an [[explosion]]. Later on that evening Buzz Bannon's body was discovered. JJ had donned the armor, but couldn't tell his grandfather (who, in a fit of rage, accused the Human Fly of killing Bannon). JJ knew that the body armor was the only way he could get revenge for Buzz's death. He kept the armor a secret from his grandfather and, in memory of his friend, called himself the Buzz.\n\nLater, Richie, having seen Buzz die, agreed to help JJ with his armor from an electronics equipped van. With Ritchie's help, the Buzz was able to find and defeat Jade.\n\nThe Buzz soon met [[Spider-Girl]], but she was leery of him, since she had been reading in the Daily Bugle that Buzz was a murderer. Buzz, however, convinced her he wasn't like his grandfather, and later helped her form a new team of [[New Warriors]], (including [[Ladyhawk (comics)|Ladyhawk]], the [[Raptor (Marvel Comics)#Brenda Drago|Raptor]], [[Darkdevil]], and [[Phil Urich]] (the good [[Green Goblin]]). He is currently considered to be on active duty. Recently, he was attacked by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], but suffered only minor damage.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nJack Jameson has no superhuman abilities of his own but his power comes from the Human Fly armor. The armor gives him superhuman strength and flight. His [[Gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]]s can fire blasts of [[electricity]] (his \"Bug Zapper\") or ribbons of [[adhesive]] [[polymer]] (his \"Fly Paper\"). His goggles give him 360 degree vision.  \n\nThe neural interface of the armor is bonded specifically to Jack Jameson and will not work for anyone else.\n\n{{MC2}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ron Frenz]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics titles]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics 2]]"}]}}}}
