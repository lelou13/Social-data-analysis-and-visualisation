His astonishing brainpower is enhanced (in military terms) by sheer, analytical ruthlessness\".<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20329 ALL THE KINGS' MEN: The Knights], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 5, 2009</ref>\n\nMentor appeared as part of the \"Imperial Guard\" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #6.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMentor is a long-time member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]], an army of powerful beings that enforce Shi'ar Imperial law on all planets within the Shi'ar Galaxy and serve the rulers of the Shi'ar Empire. Mentor was among the first of the Guard to clash with the [[X-Men]] and [[Starjammers]] as they fought to free Shi'ar Empress [[Lilandra Neramani]] from her brother, [[D'Ken]] and [[Erik the Red (comics)|Davan Shakari]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Mentor swore his allegiance to Lilandra after D'Ken's defeat.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nUnlike many of his fellow guardsmen, he remained steadfast in his loyalty to Empress Lilandra during the attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by her sister [[Deathbird]], which pitted [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] against the Guard once again.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nMentor was one of the Imperial Guard members stationed on Earth for a time.<ref>''Imperial Guard'' #1\u20134</ref>\n\nIn the battle between the Imperial Guard and [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], he acted as a tactical advisor to Gladiator on Vulcan's weakness, and oversaw the temporary neutralization of his powers, establishing him as one of the survivors of the battle that proved otherwise disastrous for the Guard.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nMentor serves as Praetor of the Imperial Guard after Gladiator becomes the new Shi'ar Majestor.<ref>''Realm of Kings: Imperial Guard'' #2</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nSeveral of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]] team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. ([[Dave Cockrum]], co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the ''Legion''). Mentor is based on LSH member [[Brainiac 5]].<ref>Degaton, Per, and Will U.
