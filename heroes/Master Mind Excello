Held in stasis with ten other fellow heroes and the deactivated robot [[Electro (comics)#Electro .28Timely Comics.29|Elektro]], he is scheduled to be shipped to a secret lab to gain insight on American superheroes. The surrender of Germany, and the collapse of the cave in which the heroes are held, meant that Excello was never smuggled away, and was left to sleep for sixty years.<ref name=\\"The Twelve #1\\"/><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11312 Mystery Men\'s Dozen: Brevoort Talks \\"The Twelve\\"], July 26, 2007, [[Comic Book Resources]]</ref>\\n\\nAwakened in modern times, Excello now finds his sensory powers overburdened by the noise and broadcast communications of the modern world, and unable to see the future.  He taps into his Swiss bank account, which has ballooned with decades\' worth of interest, and moves away from his fellow heroes to a quieter mansion with lead-lined walls in upstate New York.<ref>\'\'The Twelve\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\nIn the series\' last issue, Excello reveals the origin and nature of his powers to the [[Phantom Reporter]] following the death of [[Fiery Mask]]. According to Excello, he was born into a life of wealth and privilege, the son of a famous [[nuclear science]] researcher, who had rejected a life of scientific advancement for one of [[gambling]] and petty [[vices]]. Although dedicated towards spending his family\'s fortune as quickly as his father could make it, Excello soon realized that he possessed a form of low-level telepathy (rationalized as [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]) which made it possible for him to aways win at games of chance due his ability to \\"guess\\" the future. This ability was later amplified after Excello was exposed to a [[radioactive]] bullet, created by his father for use against the Nazis, and fired at Excello after he used his powers to prevent a [[double agent]] from assassinating his father with the same bullet. Although he was shot through the skull, the bullet travelled through Excello\'s \'\'[[corpus callosum]]\'\' and united his brain\'s two hemispheres, increasing his telepathy and cognition at the cost of having the bullet\'s [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] permanently lodged in his brain. Excello goes on to say that every time he uses his powers the bullet shards move closer to killing him, and thus, he must be mindful of how often he uses them. At the end of the series, Excello decides to use his inheritance to fund \'\'EXC Executive\'\', a private investigation agency which he hopes will make a difference in the world; he hires Phantom Reporter and [[Black Widow (Claire Voyant)|The Black Widow]] as agents.<ref>\'\'The Twelve\'\' #12</ref>\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{refbegin}}\\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=9414|title=Master Mind Excello (Golden Age)}}\\n{{refend}}\\n\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Timely Comics characters]]\\n[[Category:Golden Age superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
