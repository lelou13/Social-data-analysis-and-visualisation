After the Superhuman Registration Act is passed, Thor Girl interferes in a jewel theft undertaken by the [[Grey Gargoyle]], a previous foe of hers, and dispatches him, preventing the jewel heist in the process.

The Initiative's black ops team, including the empathic metamorph Trauma, are sent in to free Thor Girl and her compatriots, with Trauma assuming the form and powers of Thor as he battles the Warbound, leaving Thor Girl awestruck by the encounter.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5.

When the [[Skrull Kill Krew]] arrives to the scene, [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] confirms that Thor Girl is a Skrull, killing her with her own hammer with the help of [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18.

She is quite confused about why Odin took all of the Asgardians back to the Asgard Realm, and is still deciding as to whether she should join them.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs her powers are based upon the Asgardians, Thor Girl possesses the conventional physical attributes of the Asgardian gods. She is immune to all Earthly diseases and is highly durable, able to withstand attacks which would destroy an ordinary human. She also will heal at incredible speeds due to her godly life force. Thor Girl also possesses superhuman strength which rivals the most powerful of the gods and her now Asgardian-level metabolism provides her with far greater than human endurance in all physical activities. Additionally, like most Asgardians, she is near-ageless with a lifetime which may stretch into several millennia.{{issue|date=July 2014}}\n\nAs Thor Girl, Tarene wields a gold hammer through which she could channel her powers as a continuous beam of energy capable of knocking Thor off his feet and shattering buildings. Like Thor, she can also use her hammer to fly and control the weather, allowing her to summon storms, gusts of wind, create lightning bolts and various other effects. She can also traverse dimensional barriers such as from Earth to Asgard.{{issue|date=July 2014}}\n\nWhen she had her cosmic powers, the full extent of what she could do was unknown, but it was stated her powers were on a level that closely rivaled Odin's.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}\n\n==Other versions==\nIn one alternate future world, Thor Girl tried to reach back in time to empower the alien [[Desak]] trying to locate a missing Thor.<ref>''Thor Annual 2001''</ref><ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #48, 50</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvel wiki|Thor_Girl|Thor Girl}}\n*[http://Marvel.wikia.com/Tarene_%28Earth-616%29 Thor Girl] at Marvel Wikia\n\n{{Thor}}\n{{Initiative}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita, Jr.]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Asgardians]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dan Jurgens]]"}]}}}}
