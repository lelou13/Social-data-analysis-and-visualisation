B. Cebulski]] was at one point planning to write a new miniseries starring North, though this project has not been discussed in a while.<ref>[http://www.thrillingdetective.com/north.html Thrilling Detective] reference.</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography== \nDakota North is the daughter of Samuel J. North, a retired agent of the [[CIA]].<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #117 (September 2008)</ref>  Little is known about Dakota North's early life, other than at a relatively young age she chose a career as a freelance [[private investigator]].  Her business is apparently quite successful, in that it currently supports four branch offices across the world.\n\nHer earliest recorded case involved being hired by famous fashion designer Luke Jacobson to guard both him and his newest designs. This case was the first time she butted heads with her rival Carolina South.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nHer next case, which she took at the request of her father for his old friend, Major George C. Cooper, required her to guard a deadly sample of an experimental gas.  However the gas, stored in a gold pen, ended up in the possession of Dakota's brother, who had been led to Europe by a spy. Dakota followed Ricky to Switzerland where she and her brother were captured by Sheik Ibn Bheik.  They managed to escape, however the gas sample was released, killing the Sheik and all of his men.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nDakota was next hired by a coalition of modeling firms to track down a serial killer dubbed the Slasher, who had been murdering fashion models with a straight razor.  This led to Dakota guarding fashion models Elyse Nelson and [[Mary Jane Watson]]. During her guard Dakota met [[Spider-Man]] and the two cracked the case, learning that Ms. Nelson is the Slasher and saving Mary Jane's life.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nShe was next hired by [[Jack Power]] (who at the time was Counterweight) to clear children's author Jessie Wilcox Jones of theft charges.  While investigating, Dakota met the [[Punisher]], who had been contacted by Jack's sister, [[Katie Power|Katie]] (Starstreak). Working with the other heroes, Jones' innocence was eventually proven.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nSome time later, during a day of shopping, Dakota became involved in a battle between the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and King-Size, an Inhuman [[Shapeshifting|shape-shifter]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nHer next case led her to Chicago where she was hired to gather information on the recently relocated [[Luke Cage]].  She ultimately befriended Cage, helping him with a situation involving his father and brother, before she returned to New York.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nDuring the time when Malice, the former Dora Milaje once known as Nakia, sought to kill all those dear to the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], Dakota was hired by the Panther to safeguard Monica Lynne.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nMost recently, Dakota has been hired by the law firm [[Foggy Nelson|Nelson]] & [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Murdock]] as an investigator and bodyguard. She was recommended to Foggy Nelson by her friend [[Jessica Jones]], who previously held the position but has had to relinquish it due to her responsibilities as a new mother.  At one point while in his employ, she was shot and hospitalized.  Her father Samuel became involved in the case and helped resolve it.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol. 2 #106-110</ref>\n\nFollowing the incapacitation of Murdock's wife, [[Milla Donovan]], Dakota became closer to him.  Eventually, this led to them having a brief affair, which they both immediately regretted.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol.2 #111-112''</ref>\n\nDakota was later stripped of her private investigator's license as part of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s plot to frame the H.A.M.M.E.R. director [[Norman Osborn]] for going after Daredevil's friends to manipulate Matt Murdock to take further action against Osborn as well as further criminalizing his actions with [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]]. Using a compromising photograph, Dakota and Foggy forced the judge who had both of their professional licenses revoked to learn the Kingpin was behind their recent problems, leading her to decide that they need to locate Murdock at once.<ref>''Daredevil #503-504</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDakota North is skilled in several forms of hand-to-hand combat. She has trained herself to be extremely physically agile and moderately adept at gymnastics. Her excellent physical condition provides her with reflexes, recovery time, and stamina above the norm for a woman of her physical age and build. North is also proficient with a variety of firearms, and is an excellent marksman.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/northdakota.htm|Dakota North}}\n\n[[Category:1986 comic debuts]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986|North, Dakota]]\n[[Category:Fictional private investigators|North, Dakota]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists|North, Dakota]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics titles]]"}]}}}}
