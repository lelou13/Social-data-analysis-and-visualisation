He is featured in the [[X-Men: Eve of Destruction|Eve of Destruction]] story arc in Uncanny X-Men.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nPaulie first appears in the [[X-Men: Eve of Destruction|Eve of Destruction]] storyline, beginning in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #392.\\n\\nAfter just being discharged from the [[United States Marines]], \'\'\'Paul Provenzano\'\'\' returns to his home in [[Brooklyn]], where he attempts to take over the local \'chapter\' of the [[Mafia]]. The three leaders, whom Paulie has known all his life, were meeting in a local bakery, a mob-owned business. The leader declared he would not be popular if he made a \\"made man\\" out of a mutant. Paulie explains he was taking over. At first they were amused by his declarations, then they shoot him. Paulie easily resists their bullets, then brutally injures the men.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}\\n\\n[[Jean Grey]] surprises and lectures him on the seeming waste of using his powers to take over the local mob. Paulie correctly guesses that she is here to recruit him into the X-Men and agrees to join, if only to see her in her costume. Jean\'s intention is to recruit Paulie for a mission to [[Genosha]], to rescue the rest of the [[X-Men]] from [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].{{Issue|date=July 2010}}\\n\\nJean briefly leaves Paulie to enter the X-Mansion while she talks with [[Sunpyre]] on the front driveway. Paulie is thrown through the front doors moments later. [[Northstar (comics)|Northstar]] follows. Paulie protests, revealing his homophobia and Northstar protests as he is gay. Paulie dares Northstar to hit him, as he, Paulie is invulnerable.  Throughout the storyline, Paulie regularly calls Northstar \\"Maple-Leaf\\" and puts him down for being homosexual Northstar\'s super-speed is enough to stun, but not hurt him.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}\\n\\nDuring the trip Genosha, Paul and teammate [[Wraith (Hector Rendoza)|Hector Rendoza]] receive a telepathic \'crash course\' in their mutant powers, allowing them better control and understanding.  Moments later Paul suggests that he and Jean enter the cargo bay for \'privacy\'. As a rebuttal, she makes him perceive her as elderly and overweight, an unpleasant visual. He also participates in a telepathic jaunt into Dazzler\'s mind, to see what had recently ravaged the dimension she had arrived from. The attackers were childlike versions of the alternate reality [[Age of Apocalypse]] villains. This Paulie is one of the few people in current continuity to have an inkling of what had gone on in said alternate reality.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}\\n\\nPaulie and the others end up in a Genoshan public square, attempting to rescue Professor Xaiver. The makeshift team battles Magneto. Paulie is convinced that Magneto has slain Dazzler, though this is later proven untrue. After diversionary taunting, the villain launches Paulie towards space, but Northstar saves him. This results in Paulie offering an apology for his behavior to Northstar.  Which Northstar accepts,  Magneto is soon subdued by the X-Man Wolverine.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}\\n\\nBack at the [[X-Mansion]], despite an offer to stay, most of the team, including Paulie, left.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nOmert\\u00e0 has complete invulnerability and superhuman strength.\\n(Can lift up to 20 tonnes)\\n\\n==Notes==\\n*Paulie was planned to be in the Neverland Camps in [[Weapon X]], and supposedly died, but due to a coloring mistake, it cannot be confirmed that it was him in the gas chambers after all.  Also, Paulie never took the name \\"Omert\\u00e0\\" in canon, but that was his original name to begin with{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.\\n\\n==Other Marvel characters named Omert\\u00e0==\\n*Paulie is the second character featured in Marvel comics to use the name Omert\\u00e0. In issue #108 (May 1992) of \'\'[[Alpha Flight]]\'\', an [[Italian people|Italian]] superhero appeared using this name. In Italian, [[Omert\\u00e0]] signifies the [[Mafia]]\'s law of silence.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/omertaprove.htm|Omerta}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Provenzano, Paulie}}\\n[[Category:Characters created by Scott Lobdell]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2001]]\\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Italian descent]]\\n[[Category:Fictional soldiers]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
