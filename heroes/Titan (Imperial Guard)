Titan was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutants known as the [[X-Men]] who sought to rescue the [[Lilandra Neramani|Princess Lilandra]] from her insane brother emperor [[D'Ken]]. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men on a nameless Shi'ar Empire planet, and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the [[Starjammers]] arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #107</ref>\n\nSome time later, when [[Deathbird]] was empress, Titan joined the other Imperial Guard members in battle against [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] and the Starjammers. Titan fought [[Captain Britain]].<ref>''X-Men Spotlight On: Starjammers'' #2</ref> Later, on Deathbird's behalf, Titan assisted the other Imperial Guardsmen in battle against the X-Men and Starjammers, but was defeated by them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #275</ref>\n\nLater after Lilandra became leader of the Shi'ar Empire, Titan was amongst a small group of Imperial Guard that defended their Empress Lilandra against the [[Kree]] super-team known as Starforce, during the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires.  Titan battled the [[Supremor]] android.<ref>''Thor'' #446</ref> Titan also joined in the Imperial Guard's battle with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] on the Shi'ar throne world of Chandilar during the Kree-Shi'ar War, but was defeated by the [[Scarlet Witch]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #82</ref>\n\nIn the battle against [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], Titan seemed to have been killed,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #480</ref> but was actually only seriously wounded and later reappeared.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTitan has the ability to increase his size and mass at will and decrease his size back to normal height. Titan's extra mass is drawn psionically from an extra-dimensional source, to which it returns as he decreases in size. His weight increases as a cube (factor multiplied by itself three times) as he grows in height. As Titan grows in height, his strength, stamina, and durability increase proportionately, even to superhuman levels at large enough sizes.  Titan's costume is made of Shi'ar fabrics mimicking the properties of unstable molecules, making them able to expand and contract as Titan changes size.\n\nTitan is a good hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by the Imperial Guard.\n\n==Inspiration==\nSeveral of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]] team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. [[Dave Cockrum]] (co-creator of the Guard) also had a long run as artist on the Legion. Titan is based on Legion of Super-Heroes member [[Gim Allon|Colossal Boy]].<ref>Moreels, Eric J.
