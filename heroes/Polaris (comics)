Created by [[Arnold Drake]], [[Don Heck]], [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]] and [[Jim Steranko]],<ref>http://www.comics.org/issue/22260/</ref> Polaris first appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]\'\' #49 (October, 1968). For most of her publication history, she has been a [[Superhero#Female superheroes|superheroine]], and a member of either the X-Men or one of its sister groups, such as [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], though from 1987 to 1989, she was possessed by a villainous telepathic entity, and functioned as the supervillain [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]].\\n\\nA [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Polaris can control [[magnetism]], much like [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], whom she long suspected to be her biological father, a fact confirmed in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #431 (2003), making her also the half sister of the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]].<ref>[[Austen, Chuck]]. \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #421, [[Marvel Comics]], 2003</ref> She has also had a complicated long term relationship with the X-Man [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], to whom she was engaged.\\n\\n==Publication history==\\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\\nPolaris was created by writer [[Arnold Drake]] and artist [[Jim Steranko]], and first appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]\'\' #49 (October 1968). She first appeared as a member of the X-Men in \'\'X-Men\'\' #60, in 1969, and remained a member of the team until just after the debut of a new team of X-Men in \'\'[[Giant-Size X-Men]]\'\'.  Polaris appeared as a supporting character for the team for several years before joining a new incarnation of the X-Factor team in \'\'X-Factor\'\' #70 (September 1991), remaining with that team until \'\'X-Factor\'\' #149 (September 1998).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n\\n===Origin===\\nLorna Dane met the original team of [[X-Men]] while still a student.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #49</ref> When the villain [[Mesmero]] used his \\"psyche-generator\\" to summon mutants in North America with latent powers,<ref name=\\"X-Men vol. 1 #50\\">\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #50</ref> Lorna found herself compelled to travel to San Francisco, where Mesmero was. There she encountered the X-Man [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], who broke her trance by causing her to slip on a patch of ice and then convinced her to come to his apartment.  At the apartment, Lorna met the rest of the X-Men who soon learned that she had latent mutant powers. Mesmero and his android Demi-Men captured her and took her to their desert headquarters, with the X-Men in pursuit.\\n\\nWhen the X-Men attempted to rescue her, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] revealed himself as the leader of the group behind her abduction\\u2014and, more importantly, claimed to be Lorna\'s father.  Despite the X-Men\'s assertions that Magneto is evil, Lorna could not bring herself to fight her own father.<ref name=\\"X-Men vol. 1 #50\\"/> [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] returns from meeting with her foster parents who told him that her birth parents had died in a plane crash years earlier.  This information caused Lorna to turn against Magneto<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #51-52</ref> but it was later revealed that she had caused the accident and Magneto had her memories of it erased with the help of Mastermind.<ref>X-Factor #243, 2012</ref> For a while, Iceman was attracted to her, but Lorna did not truly reciprocate the feelings.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #52</ref> She did however, fall in love with her teammate [[Havok (comics)|Havok]].<ref>X-Men vol. 1 #58, 1969</ref>\\n\\nUnbeknownst to Lorna, the Magneto who claimed to be her father is revealed to be an android. Shortly after, Lorna was captured by [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], but was rescued by the X-Men.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #57-58</ref> Lorna joined the X-Men and began living at [[X-Mansion|Xavier\'s mansion]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #60, 1969</ref> Lorna aided [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and the X-Men in repelling the alien [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#Z|Z\'Nox]]\'s attempted invasion of Earth.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #65</ref>\\n\\nLorna Dane\'s first \\"code name\\" was Magnetrix, but she quickly decided that she did not like this name.  However, that did not keep Havok from continuing to use that name as a way to annoy and flirt with her.<ref>X-Men: The Hidden Years #3 (2000)</ref> The two leave the X-Men to pursue their mutual interest in [[geophysics]].{{issue|date=September 2012}} They moved to the Diablo mountain range in California.{{issue|date=September 2012}}\\n\\nLorna, with Havok, is later seen battling the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>\'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' #150</ref> When the old and new X-Men fought the mutant island [[Krakoa]], Lorna displayed the full potential of her powers for the first time by disrupting the Earth\'s magnetic field, which sent Krakoa into deep space.<ref>\'\'Giant-Size X-Men\'\' #1</ref> They then joined [[Moira MacTaggert]] at her facility for genetic research on [[Muir Island]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #94</ref>\\n\\n===Mind controlled===\\n[[Image:Polarisshiarxmen97.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Polaris in her Shi\'ar-designed outfit, while under the control of Erik the Red. Art by [[Dave Cockrum]] and [[Sam Grainger]].]]\\n\\nLorna received a new costume of [[Shi\'ar]] design, when her mind came under the domination of the Shi\'ar Intelligence agent Davan Shakari, also known as [[Erik the Red (comics)|Erik the Red]]. It was Erik the Red who gave Lorna the codename \'\'\'Polaris,\'\'\' which she has continued to use ever since. At the time, Shakari served [[D\'Ken]], then emperor of the Shi\'ar Galaxy. Shakari kidnapped [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]] and Lorna, and subjected them to a powerful form of mind control. He turned them against the X-Men in an attempt to assassinate [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]. A massive battle ensued at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Kennedy International Airport]], with the duo battling the X-Men. Polaris was defeated by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], but Shakari managed to escape with both her and Havok. Xavier eventually freed both Polaris and Havok from Shakari\'s control.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' Vol. 1 #97 (1976)</ref>\\n\\nPolaris and Havok remained inactive as members of the X-Men, though they did return from time to time to assist the team. With the X-Men, they battled [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] on Muir Island.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #125-128</ref> For the most part, Lorna and Alex remained in civilian life for a number of years, settling in New Mexico and completing their college degrees. They were forced to reluctantly help the X-Men in [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]\'s Murderworld.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #145-146</ref> Their new life was interrupted when the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] ambushed them around the time of the [[Mutant Massacre]]. Polaris\\u2019 mind was overtaken by the psionic being known as [[Malice (comics)#Malice|Malice]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #219</ref>\\n\\nUnder Malice\\u2019s control, Lorna attacked the X-Men as leader of the Marauders.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #221-222</ref> Shortly thereafter, the Malice entity found that it had become permanently bonded to Lorna\\u2019s body.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #239</ref> She led the Marauders against the X-Men during [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #240-241, 243; \'\'X-Factor\'\' #39</ref> After [[Mister Sinister]] was seemingly killed, Malice\'s hold over Lorna weakened.  Temporarily regaining control of her own mind, Lorna was able to place a phone call to the X-Men in Australia for help, but they arrived too late. Lorna had been taken to be with her alleged half-sister [[Zaladane]], a priestess for the Savage Land\'s Sun People.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #249</ref> The X-Men arrived in time to witness Zaladane\'s getaway, though Havok managed to infiltrate her army in disguise while the X-Men followed. In the Savage Land, the X-Men found that Zaladane had amassed an army of Savage Land natives who were being mentally controlled for her by [[Worm (comics)|Worm]], one of the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. Zaladane revealed that she is in fact Lorna\'s sister and, using the [[High Evolutionary]]\'s machinery, stripped Lorna of her magnetic powers, taking them as her own. In addition, the process managed to finally separate Lorna from Malice. Zaladane and her forces clashed with [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] and the X-Men. During the encounter, Lorna\'s [[secondary mutation]] activated:  she grew in height, became invulnerable, and gained superhuman strength. Zaladane\'s army was released from Worm\'s control, and Lorna finally regained her freedom.<ref name=\\"Uncanny X-Men #250\\">\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #250</ref>\\n\\nHaving nowhere else to go, Lorna went to [[Moira MacTaggert]]\'s mutant research station on [[Muir Island]]. On her way there, her secondary mutation activated again, as evidenced by a sudden increase in height. At this time, she discovered that her new mutation also affects those around her, amplifying negative emotions such as anger and hate.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #253</ref>\\n\\n===Muir Island===\\nUpon examination, Dr. MacTaggert was at a loss to explain Lorna\'s new mutation, although she did confirm that the only way Zaladane could have taken her powers away was if she had been a biological sibling.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #254</ref>  Shortly after her arrival, Lorna joined the [[List of X-Men members#Muir Island X-Men .281989.29|Muir Island X-Men]] team formed by Moira and former X-Man [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #255</ref>  This team defended Muir Island from the attacking [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], who were hunting for [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #257-258</ref>\\n\\nPrior to this time, it had not been clear that Polaris was actually drawing strength from being a nexus for negative emotional energies. Polaris\\u2019 status as a nexus, however, was perceived by the villainous [[Shadow King]].  The Shadow King used Polaris as a gateway to allow him access to the physical world from the [[astral plane]], causing a world-wide increase in anger, hatred, and violence in the process.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #269</ref> Polaris was freed of his influence with the help of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and the X-Men during the [[Muir Island Saga]].<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #69</ref> Upon the defeat of the Shadow King, Polaris\\u2019 magnetic powers return due to a combination of Zaladane\'s death a short time before and the neural-disruptive psionic blade of the X-Man [[Psylocke]], leaving no trace of her increased size, strength, or emotion-control powers.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men #278-280\'\'</ref>\\n\\n===X-Factor===\\nPolaris was then asked to join the newly formed [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] by [[Valerie Cooper]], and, tired of hiding out on Muir Island, she accepted.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #70</ref> Havok and Polaris were set as its leaders. Although joining X-Factor offered Polaris the chance to reunite with Havok, their relationship remained largely unresolved.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #71</ref> Polaris was able to come to terms with her experiences with mind control thanks to psychiatrist [[Doc Samson|Dr. Leonard Samson]], helping her to develop her confidence.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #87</ref> Polaris developed a strong belief in Xavier\'s dream while a member of X-Factor.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #94</ref> Polaris became the government\'s secret weapon against a possible attack from Magneto, with the government hiring the mercenary [[Random (comics)|Random]] to test her abilities.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #95</ref> Malice later returned to bother her once more but Havok and Polaris, out of their love for each other, each tried to absorb her, preventing the other from being possessed. In the end, Malice perished at the hands of [[Mister Sinister]].<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #104-105</ref>\\n\\nShortly thereafter, Havok was kidnapped by agents of the [[Dark Beast]], who forged a note explaining that Havok needed to get away from Polaris. This devastated Polaris, causing her to feel abandoned and betrayed.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #118</ref> X-Factor\'s atmosphere changed as the criminals [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] were forced by the government to join the group.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #114</ref><ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #120</ref> Polaris began to question her place on the team after this, especially as most of her original teammates were no longer active. She discovered Havok\'s fate as he attacked X-Factor with the Dark Beast\'s agents, apparently under mind-control. After Havok was defeated, Polaris tried to reach out to him, only to be attacked and severely injured when she felt she could trust him.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #125-126</ref> When Sabretooth betrayed and attacked the team, Polaris was severely injured.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #136</ref>\\n\\nAfter recovering from her injuries, and learning that Havok\'s \\"terrorist\\" activities had been a front for his true undercover work, Polaris forgave him, although she rejected him romantically.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #148</ref> She also agreed to join Havok\'s new X-Factor team. However, during their first team meeting, she could only watch as Havok was seemingly killed in the explosion of a faulty [[time travel|time machine]] constructed by the mutant from the future, [[Greystone (comics)|Greystone]].<ref name=\\"X-Factor vol. 1 #149\\">\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #149</ref> Although Havok had left Polaris in charge of his team while trying to stop Greystone, she apparently did not feel like she could keep the team together, and they disbanded shortly thereafter.<ref name=\\"X-Factor vol. 1 #149\\"/>\\n\\n===The Twelve===\\nWeeks later, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] encountered Lorna in a church and she confided in him that she felt she was being followed and that she was sure Alex was still alive.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #94</ref>  A group of [[Skrull]]s working with [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] were indeed shadowing her and broke into her apartment to retrieve the headgear from Havok\'s original costume. Lorna then learned that she was one of [[Apocalypse: The Twelve|The Twelve]], a team of mutants supposedly destined to usher in a new golden age for mutant-kind.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #376</ref> Polaris journeyed with the X-Men to [[Egypt]] to battle Apocalypse.  During the encounter, Magneto, another member of The Twelve, discovered that he could use Lorna to tap into the Earth\'s magnetic field with incredible force, effectively hiding the reduced state of his powers at the time.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #97</ref>\\n\\n===Acolyte===\\nAfter [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] was defeated, Polaris returned to [[Genosha]] with Magneto to supply him with power and help him keep order. She believed she was doing it for the greater good, but also enjoyed the education in her powers that she received. Magneto launched a full-scale assault on Carrion Cove, the last city opposing his rule, in order to gain access to technology that would restore his full abilities. Polaris attempted to stop him, but she was defeated and left the country with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. She later returned with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] to help oppose Magneto\'s tyrannical rule.<ref>\'\'Magneto: Dark Seduction\'\' #1-4</ref>\\n\\nAlthough Quicksilver was discovered and forced to leave Genosha, Polaris maintained a low profile in order to covertly transport refugees from the war to other nations, as well as monitor Magneto\\u2019s actions.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #113</ref> After Magneto\\u2019s spine was severed by Wolverine, Polaris was able to steal a blood sample from his medical tests, which she used to confirm that Magneto was her biological father.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #430</ref> When [[Cassandra Nova]]\\u2019s [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] destroyed Genosha and massacred millions, Polaris was one of the few survivors. She was left emotionally scarred after witnessing the massacre after being unable to save them.<ref name=\\"Uncanny\\">\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #431</ref>\\n\\n[[Image:Polaris426.PNG|thumb|Polaris confronting Havok about leaving her at the altar on their wedding day. Art by [[Philip Tan (artist)|Philip Tan]].]]\\n\\n===Trauma===\\nLater, some of the X-Men went to Genosha to survey what occurred there. They encountered a [[nude]] (due to the excessive use of her powers blowing her clothes apart) and deranged Polaris in Genosha sometime after its population was massacred by [[Cassandra Nova]]\'s [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>\'\'New X-Men\'\' #132</ref> When Polaris rejoined the X-Men, the extremely traumatic experience had left her with a darker, more ruthless personality, even killing some members of the anti-mutant [[Church of Humanity (comics)|Church of Humanity]]. Havok broke up with Polaris after they were about to be married, leaving her at the altar for nurse [[Annie Ghazikhanian]]. Traumatized and humiliated, the unstable Polaris went berserk and commenced to go on a rampage that nearly resulted in her killing Havok. [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] succeeded in knocking her out.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #425-426</ref> She remained this way until some psychic therapy with [[Professor X]]avier. Polaris promised to do no more harm and she was accepted back to the X-Men.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #429-434</ref>\\n\\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PolarisReload.png|thumb|left|100px|Polaris in her \'\'[[X-Men ReLoad]]\'\' costume. Art by [[Salvador Larroca]]]] -->\\n\\nIceman later admitted to Polaris that he still had feelings for her and after some mild flirtation, the two began a relationship.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol.2 #165</ref> The relationship was not to last, however, since Lorna\'s other relationships (namely with Havok) were still unresolved. Havok has confessed to still loving her after Annie had left him, however, Polaris pushed him away.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #173</ref>\\n\\n===Decimation===\\nIt was revealed that Polaris had lost her powers on [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]],<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #177</ref> but had avoided telling her teammates. When confronted by Valerie Cooper, who has knowledge of her power loss, Polaris claimed that her power loss is psychological and she believes she is preventing herself from using them. Polaris eventually was forced by circumstance to accept that her powers were gone and admit the fact to the rest of the team \\u2014 whereupon all the other members of her squad, except her would-be-paramours Iceman and Havok, revealed to her that they had already guessed it. She then left the mansion with Havok to \\"search\\" for her lost powers, irrationally convinced they lay with an alien named Daap, a seeming twin to the deceased [[X-Statix]] member [[Doop (comics)|Doop]], who she had seen on a recent mission in space. Daap soon crashed to Earth and kidnapped Polaris and the [[Leper Queen]], the leader of the anti-mutant group known as the Sapien League.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #180-181</ref>\\n\\n===Horseman of Apocalypse===\\n[[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] took them both, restrained the Leper Queen, and forcibly transformed Polaris into the new Pestilence. Seemingly mind-wiped, she ingested viruses from the [[World Health Organization]] and was attempting to create a meta-plague. In the climactic battle between the X-Men, the Avengers, and Apocalypse, Wolverine discovered a choking Pestilence was Lorna.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #182-185</ref> She was recovering in the [[X-Mansion]] when former Horsemen of Apocalypse [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] returned to take her away. She arose and refused to go with them, but also decided to quit the X-Men.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #186-187</ref> Polaris decided to leave that night to search for Apocalypse in Egypt. She went alone and was later hunted until Havok and the new Uncanny X-Men team saved her. [[Emma Frost]] has also noted that her powers seem to be \\"strange and mutating\\".<ref name=\\"Uncanny X-Men #475\\">\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #475</ref>\\n\\n===The Rise and Fall of The Shi\'ar Empire===\\nAfter being rescued from an anti-Apocalypse cult  by the new team, Polaris agreed to join [[Professor X]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] on their mission to stop [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]].<ref name=\\"Uncanny X-Men #475\\"/> Her current relationship with Havok is still developing. Polaris seemed to finally show concrete signs of forgiving Havok, telling him to \\"just shut up and kiss me\\" after the team won their first battle against the entire regiment of Shi\'ar soldiers in their beginning struggle against [[D\'Ken]] and in support of Lilandra.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #484</ref> Although Havok initially rebuffs her advances, hesitant to \\"start up again after\\" everything that happened between them, Lorna says that he needs to \\"blow off some steam\\" and the scene ends with them kissing. Polaris helps in the big fight and seriously hurts Vulcan and [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] with her powers, but in the end she is one of the X-Men left behind.<ref name=\\"Uncanny X-Men #486\\">\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #486</ref>\\n\\n===Starjammers===\\nFollowing the death of [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] at the hands of Vulcan, Polaris joined the newest incarnation of the [[Starjammers]], intending to kill Vulcan and restore [[Lilandra Neramani]] to the Shi\'ar throne.<ref name=\\"Uncanny X-Men #486\\"/> Their mission proved unsuccessful and Polaris, along with Havok, [[Ch\'od]], and [[Raza Longknife|Raza]], was captured and incarcerated on an underwater planet by Vulcan.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Divided We Stand\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\n===X-Men: Kingbreaker===\\nLorna was later shown to still be a prisoner of Vulcan and his forces. Vulcan ordered her to be heavily drugged so they can further study this.<ref name=\\"X-Men: Kingbreaker #1\\">\'\'X-Men: Kingbreaker\'\' #1</ref> She was later freed by Havok and the other Starjammers, who vowed to kill Vulcan.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Kingbreaker\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\n===War of Kings===\\nPolaris and the Starjammers played a large role in the War of Kings storyline, which also featured Vulcan, The Inhumans, Nova, and The Guardians of the Galaxy.<ref>http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.4329</ref> Pursued by a Shi\'ar superdestroyer after escaping, Lorna uses the fact that she is [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]]\'s [[sister-in-law]] to allow the Starjammers through the Kree\'s defensive shield.<ref>\'\'War of Kings\'\' #1</ref> After the Shi\'ar Imperial Guard\'s attack on Crystal and Ronan\'s wedding, Lorna plays a minor but pivotal role in regaining Kree popular support for the Inhumans by making sure that Crystal\'s humanitarian acts towards the injured Kree civilians are broadcast all over the Kree networks.<ref>\'\'War of Kings\'\' #2</ref> After this, she once again joins the Starjammers on their mission to rescue Lilandra. They promptly commandeer a Shi\'ar Ironclad (which she helps capture by magnetizing the Starjammer to its hull) which they then use to join the main Shi\'ar fleet until their cover is blown when they rescue [[Rocket Raccoon]] and his team, the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #13</ref> Following the surrender of the Shi\'ar to the Inhumans, Lorna remains on the Shi\'ar homeworld along with Havok and Marvel Girl.<ref>\'\'War of Kings: Who Will Rule #1\'\'</ref>\\n\\n===Realm of Kings===\\nThrough Ch\'od, and apparently due to the incident of Rachel and Korvus both losing the connection to the Phoenix Force, it is known that Polaris, Havok, Rachel and Korvus have departed for Earth.<ref>\'\'Realm of Kings: Imperial Guard\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\n===X-Men Legacy===\\n[[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]], and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] respond to Rachel\'s destress call and Rogue uses Legion\'s powers to teleport to the space station they are on.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #253</ref> Lorna, Korvus and Alex are mind controlled by an alien force and are being used to help kill and torture Shi\'ar.<ref name=\\"X-Men: Legacy #255\\">\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #255</ref> When she meets up with Magneto their reunion is short lived as the Shi\'ar attack the assembled group and Lorna, Alex and Korvus attack Magneto, Frenzy and Gambit.<ref name=\\"X-Men: Legacy #255\\"/> Rachel\'s actions break them free of the mind control and the X-Men join forces.
