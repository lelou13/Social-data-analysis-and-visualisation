To cope with his grief, Gabriel joined a [[seminary]] and eventually took holy orders as a priest.<ref name=\"mu11\">''[[Monsters Unleashed]]'' #11 (Jan 1975)</ref> Gabriel was possessed by a demon named Catherine, who compelled him to rip out his right eye, set fire to his holy sacraments, and burn his own house down. Gabriel grabbed a red hot metal cross and held it to his naked chest, searing the shape of the cross into his flesh and driving the demon from his body. Gabriel later met with the mysterious woman [[Desadia]], and the two embarked on the career of professional exorcists.<ref>''[[Haunt of Horror]]'' #2 (July 1974)</ref> Desadia eventually became Gabriel's wife.<ref name=\"mu11\"/>\n\nGabriel often worked for ordinary people, but he also occasionally assisted superhumans as well, such as [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]].<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' #9</ref> Gabriel maintained an office on the 13th floor of [[New York City]]'s [[Empire State Building]].<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | date = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 52\u201361 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>\n\nGabriel learned of [[Franklin Richards]]' possession by [[Nicholas Scratch]] and went to the [[Baxter Building]] to perform the exorcism. He forced Scratch to reveal himself, and accompanied [[Agatha Harkness]], Franklin, and the [[Fantastic Four]] to New Salem, keeping Scratch subdued on the trip. The group was captured by [[Salem's Seven]], whose power was augmented by Scratch. Gabriel and Agatha Harkness were able to forge the Fantastic Four's love for Franklin into a weapon, and drove Scratch out.<ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #222-223 (Sept-Oct, 1980)</ref>\n\nGabriel left before the Fantastic Four could thank him, and continued to be plagued by demons. He retired for a time, and earned a meager living by writing occult \"news\" stories for the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''World Gossip Weekly'' and performing mock exorcisms for people interested in the occult. It was revealed that Desadia had been killed by the powers of evil. Gabriel helped [[Daimon Hellstrom]] foil the designs of a Daimon Hellstrom impostor performing human sacrifices in San Francisco. During this sequence of events, Gabriel was also able to overcome his crippling depression.<ref>''[[Daimon Hellstrom|Hellstorm]]'' #1</ref>\n\nGabriel later came into conflict with [[Daimon Hellstrom]] again, and he spiraled back into depression and alcoholism, and was on the verge of suicide.<ref>''[[Daimon Hellstrom|Hellstorm]]'' #7-10</ref> He was contacted by the [[Asura (comics)|Asura]], the assassins of Heaven, and was convinced to work for them as a killer of demons.<ref>''[[Daimon Hellstrom|Hellstorm]]'' #12-14</ref> He later acquired a \"Breathing Gun\", a firearm capable of killing demons.<ref>''[[Daimon Hellstrom|Hellstorm]]'' #20</ref>\n\nA final confrontation with Hellstrom left Gabriel irretrievably insane, only capable of babbling incoherently. Hellstrom left him in the care of the [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Isaac Christians)|Gargoyle]].<ref>''[[Daimon Hellstrom|Hellstorm]]'' #21</ref>\n\n==Powers, abilities, and equipment==\nGabriel is a trained exorcist, and if he failed to completely exorcise a demon, he was still able to suppress it, to minimize the harm it would cause its host. He had a cross-shaped scar burned into his chest, which he frequently used against the demons he fought. For a period of time he was also assisted during exorcisms by the spirit of his dead wife Andrea. While employed by the [[Asura (comics)|Asura]], Gabriel owned a \"Breathing Gun\", a firearm that was able to harm or even kill demons.\n\nGabriel himself, either in spite of his abilities or because of them, was constantly plagued by demons attempting to [[Demonic possession|possess]] him.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/gabriel.htm|Gabriel the Devil-Hunter}}\n* http://marvel.com/universe/Gabriel%2C_Devil-Hunter\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Fictional exorcists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
