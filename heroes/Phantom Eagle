Kaufman had become an expert stunt-pilot and co-owner of a flying circus, by 1917, when the [[United States]] entered [[World War I]], and desired to fight the [[Central Powers]]. Concealing his identity so as not to risk reprisals against his parents, he devised a stylized aviator uniform with darkened goggles and a cape, and joined the European conflict to become an ace on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] as a U.S. Army Air Corps test pilot. In his first mission as Phantom Eagle, he successfully led a U.S. fighter squadron against an experimental dirigible aircraft carrier with which German forces attempted to invade New York; however, he witnessed the death of his best friend, Rex Griffin, as a result.<ref>\'\'[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]\'\' #16</ref> At one point the time-traveling dictator [[Kang the Conqueror]] sent the simpleminded brute the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] back to 1917 in an effort to secure a victory for Germany, by preventing the Phantom Eagle from destroying a key German super-weapon.<ref>\'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' #135</ref> Another time, a brief altering of reality saw the Phantom Eagle\'s [[biplane]] pursued by modern [[jet fighter]]s.<ref>\'\'Thor Corps\'\' #3 (Nov. 1993)</ref>\\n\\nThe Phantom Eagle went on to join the team of costumed adventurers known as [[Freedom\'s Five]], consisting of himself (the sole American), the [[Crimson Cavalier]], the [[Silver Squire]], [[Sir Steel]], and [[Union Jack (comics)#Union Jack (James Montgomery)|Union Jack]].<ref>recounted in \'\'Invaders\'\' #7</ref>\\n\\nKaufman and his parents were later killed together near the end of the war by German pilot Hermann von Reitberger, who strafed both the Phantom Eagle and the two civilians with his machine guns as they fled from Germany into Alsace, France. Swearing vengeance, the Phantom Eagle\'s spirit haunted and hunted von Reitberger through the years until, after a chance, modern-day encounter with the original [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], he battled the aged German in aerial combat.
