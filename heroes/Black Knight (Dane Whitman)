Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[John Buscema]], he [[first appeared]] in \'\'[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]\'\' #47 (Dec. 1967)\\n\\n==Publication history==\\n{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}\\nFollowing his introduction, the Dane Whitman Black Knight became a recurring character in the superhero-team comic \'\'The Avengers\'\', with his first solo story appearing shortly afterward in the anthology title \'\'[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]\'\' #17 (Nov. 1968). From 1979 to 1980, the Black Knight also appeared in black & white feature in the [[Marvel UK]] comic \'\'[[Hulk Weekly]]\'\', where the feature was to be the longest-lasting of the comic\'s UK-originated material, appearing in the majority of the title\'s 63 issues. It was written by [[Steve Parkhouse]] with art by [[Paul Neary]] and [[John Stokes (artist)|John Stokes]].<!--cite needed for following, and [[WP:DATED]] issue fixed: the complete story is set to be reprinted in the last two volumes of Panini\'s original \'\'Captain Britain\'\' collections.--> He also appeared in his own Marvel US title, the [[miniseries]] \'\'Black Knight\'\' #1\\u20134 (June\\u2013Sept. 1990) by husband-and-wife writers [[Roy Thomas|Roy]] and [[Dann Thomas]] and successive [[penciller]]s [[Tony DeZuniga]] and [[Rich Buckler]]. This was followed by the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] \'\'Black Knight: Exodus\'\' #1 (Dec. 1996), by writer [[Ben Raab]] and penciller [[Jimmy Cheung]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n{{confusing|section|date=March 2007}}\\n===Early life===\\nDane Whitman was born in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]] and is best known as the modern-day Black Knight, continuing a legacy that began in medieval England. The first [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Black Knight]], Whitman\'s ancestor Sir Percy of Scandia, lived during the reign of King Arthur.  Percy\'s murder at the hand of his nemesis [[Mordred (comics)|Modred]] began a string of successors, all of them Percy\'s descendants.\\n\\nIt was revived by Whitman\'s uncle Nathan Garrett, who became the [[supervillain]] [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Black Knight II]].  After being mortally wounded during a battle with [[Iron Man]], he escaped to his estate, summoned his nephew to confess his crimes, and asked him to restore honor to their family legacy and atone for Garrett\'s misdeeds.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #47</ref>\\n\\n===The Avengers===\\nWhitman became the Black Knight, creating [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]] for his mount.  During his first outing, he was mistaken for his uncle and attacked by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], though they eventually realized their mistake.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #48</ref> Later, he infiltrated the [[Masters of Evil]], proving his worth to the Avengers, who offered him provisional membership.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #54</ref> Shortly afterward, he inherited Castle Garrett and traveled to England.  He encountered the spirit of Sir Percy of Scandia there and was given the [[Ebony Blade]].<ref>\'\'Marvel Super Heroes\'\' #17</ref> He then encountered [[Doctor Strange]], and helped fight the extra-dimensional threat [[Tiboro]].<ref>\'\'Doctor Strange\'\' #178</ref>\\n\\n[[Image:MarvelSuper-Heroes17.jpg|thumb|left|\'\'[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]\'\' #17 (Nov. 1968). Black Knight figure by [[John Romita Sr.]]; background art by [[Howard Purcell]] (penciller) and [[Dan Adkins]] (inker), from page 14 of story.<ref>Credits per \'\'The Official Marvel Index to the Avengers\'\' #3 (Oct. 1987), p. 22</ref>]]\\nWhile still a provisional Avenger, he helped defeat [[Kang the Conqueror]], who was given the power of death over the Avengers by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] as a prize for winning a recent game. Since Whitman was not a full Avenger at the time, Kang had no power over him, and so Whitman was able to defeat him with relative ease. Whitman then officially joined the Avengers in recognition of his aid.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #71</ref> Later the Ebony Blade was used by the Olympian war god [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], to put out the Promethean Flame and turn most of the Olympians to crystal. Black Knight travelled to Olympus with other members and helped defeat Ares.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #100</ref>\\n\\n===The Defenders and Captain Britain ===\\nWhitman was an early member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He also became the team\'s first casualty after kissing the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] \\u2013 petrifying him.<ref>\'\'The Defenders\'\' #4 (Feb. 1973)</ref> His spirit was drawn to the 12th century by the sorcerer [[Amergin (comics)|Amergin]] the [[Druid]], and he took [[spiritual possession]] of his ancestor, the Crusader Sir Eobar Garrington until Garrington died due to the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]].  Meanwhile, Whitman chose to stay in the 12th century and was cared for by fellow Defender [[Valkyrie (comics)|Valkyrie]].<ref>\'\'The Defenders\'\' #11</ref> Whitman then battled the [[Fomor (comics)|Fomor]], alongside the time-traveling Avengers.  He then employed the Evil Eye to seal the portal between Earth and [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Avalon]].  Whitman returned to the 20th century and his original body was restored.  He was accompanied by a gift from Amergin: a black, winged horse called \'\'\'[[Valinor (comics)|Valinor]]\'\'\', named after the [[Valinor|fictional location of that name]].<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #225</ref> Some time later Merlyn sent Whitman to locate the lost hero [[Captain Britain]] and, with his aid, travel to the Otherworld dimension to save Camelot.<ref>\'\'Hulk Comic\'\' #1\\u201363, March 1979 \\u2013 May 1980</ref> Both heroes were briefly kidnapped by the Grandmaster to participate in the original Contest of Champions.<ref>\'\'Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions\'\' #1\\u20133, Jun\\u2013Aug 1982</ref>\\n\\n===The Blood Curse===\\nWhitman learned the Ebony Blade was cursed: Every time it drew blood, it drove its user closer to madness.  Whitman freed Sir Percy\'s spirit from the Earthly plane, purging the blood curse from the sword.<ref>\'\'Doctor Strange\'\' vol. 2, #68\\u201369</ref> Whitman resumed active duty with the Avengers,<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #254</ref> and battled against the fourth Masters of Evil while they invaded [[Avengers Mansion]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #273\\u2013277</ref>\\n\\nWhen the [[Sub-Mariner]] used the sword to kill his wife [[Marrina (comics)|Marrina]], who had become a monster, the blood curse was revived. The curse began to transform Whitman\'s body into the same mystic metal as the blade.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #293</ref> He was forced to don an exo-skeleton when the curse\'s creeping paralysis began to affect his mobility. He also showed signs of mental instability.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #294</ref> Ultimately, the blood curse became so virulent, that it would draw blood from anyone touching the Black Knight.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #295</ref> Sir Percy took possession of Whitman\'s body to stop the blood curse.<ref>\'\'Black Knight\'\' vol. 2, #1</ref> The transformation was undone by the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]], Whitman and the ghost of Sir Percy.  Sir Percy\'s spirit merged with the sword, canceling the curse and returning Whitman to normal.<ref>\'\'Black Knight\'\' vol. 2 #4</ref> Whitman stopped using the Ebony Blade and left the Avengers.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  He later developed a weapon that projected a sword-like sheath of energy (a [[lightsaber]]) as a replacement.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  The Ebony Blade would come into the possession of Sean Dolan, who had briefly served as the \\"[[squire]]\\" of the Black Knight; it transformed Dolan into the [[Bloodwraith]].<ref>\'\'Avengers Annual\'\' #22 (1993)</ref>\\n\\n===Sersi===\\nAfter rejoining the Avengers, Whitman was a major member of the team and eventually became the de facto field leader in [[Captain America]]\'s absence.  He became romantically involved with his teammate [[Sersi]] (of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]).  This relationship soon came under strain as Sersi proved increasingly unstable due to the machinations of a man called [[Proctor (comics)|Proctor]].  In an attempt to stabilize her, fellow Eternal [[Ikaris]] mentally bonded Sersi and Whitman with a process called the \\"\'\'gann josin\'\',\\" but this did little to slow the process \\u2013 not least due to Whitman\'s resentment at having the bond imposed upon him, especially as he was beginning to turn his attentions toward [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], one of the [[Inhumans]]\' royal family.  Sersi eventually snapped completely, forcing Whitman to aid her \\u2013 until the sight of her attacking Crystal enabled him to break the \'\'gann josin\'\'\'s hold on him temporarily.  Proctor was later revealed to be an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] counterpart of Whitman.  Having been rejected by his own Sersi and twisted by the \'\'gann josin\'\' and his Ebony Blade\'s curse, he now traveled the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]] with the aid of a captured [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] named Ute on a mission to kill the Sersi of every reality.  Ultimately, Sersi slew Proctor with his own Ebony Blade and was subsequently forced to leave the Marvel Universe to restore her mind.  Whitman left with her, partly because he didn\'t want to come between Crystal and her husband [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and partly because he felt responsible for what had happened to Sersi.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\nThe pair were transported to the [[Ultraverse]] (home of the [[Malibu Comics]] characters).  They were separated and Whitman became the leader of the superhero team called [[Ultraforce (comics)|Ultraforce]].  He and Sersi briefly reunited to return to the Marvel universe, but something went wrong along the way.  Instead of returning to the Marvel universe\'s present, they ended up in the 12th century and Whitman once again found his spirit in the body of Sir Eobar Garrington.  His consciousness was buried under Garrington\'s, however, and Sersi was forced to pass Garrington\'s soul onto the next plane (with his permission) to restore Whitman\'s consciousness.  Whitman found himself embroiled in a conflict with the evil mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] alongside his ancestor\'s best friend Bennet du Paris, the mutant who would become [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]].  Apocalypse tried to get du Paris to kill his friend, but du Paris refused.  Judging him weak, Apocalypse put du Paris in a state of suspended animation.  Out of respect for his ancestor\'s friendship with du Paris, Whitman organized an order of knights to guard du Paris\' body, which they did through the ages until he was found and revived by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].  Sersi created another portal, this time to the correct time period, and she and Whitman departed the 12th century.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\nWhitman and Sersi were somehow separated in transit, which ripped their \'\'gann josin\'\' bond apart.  Whitman found himself back in New York in the proper time, but without Sersi.  He was soon dealt another shattering blow when he learned that the Avengers and most of the other major heroes had apparently perished in battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] while he was gone.  Whitman then learned the [[Lady of the Lake]] had selected him as the Pendragon for his age.  She bestowed upon him new mystical equipment from [[Avalon]]: a suit of armor, the enchanted flying horse Strider, the Shield of Night, which absorbed energy, and the Sword of Light, which returned that energy in the form of an energy projectile.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\n===Heroes for Hire===\\nThe newly empowered Knight helped the [[Heroes for Hire]] defeat [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]], then accepted [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]\'s offer to join the newly formed team (due primarily to his concern over former teammate and friend [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], who had been drinking heavily out of grief for the Avengers\' deaths). Whitman eventually learned what happened to Sersi when she reappeared asking for help to defeat yet another of her old enemy [[Ghaur]]\'s nefarious schemes.  Later, the Heroes for Hire found themselves in the midst of a major conflict in the [[High Evolutionary]]\'s city of [[Wundagore]].  The Black Knight left the team to assist the [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Knights of Wundagore]] along with Quicksilver and later returned to the Avengers when they expanded their roster to include satellite teams around the world.  Whitman was sent to the [[Slorenia]]n border, where the Bloodwraith had used the Ebony Blade to absorb the souls of the entire population after they had been killed by the android [[Ultron]].  After the \\"Kang War\\" arc, the Avengers disbanded these global teams.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\n===New Excalibur===\\nWhitman reappeared in \'\'[[New Excalibur]]\'\' in the mid-2000s. He has opened up a museum in England chronicling the Black Knights that have existed throughout history. Whitman recently learned that Sir Percy was not the original Black Knight, but that eight men had held the Ebony Blade prior. The Ebony Blade however corrupted these men, and Sir Percy was deemed the only one noble enough to wield the Blade. Also at this time, Merlin told Whitman that he must not destroy the Blade as he had previously been told to do. It is not clear whether he has access to his Avalonian equipment at present. In \'\'New Excalibur\'\', Whitman was invited to join the team but after the second adventure with them he refuses as he believes that his [[Ebony Blade]] is not the real one and needs to find the original.<ref>\'\'New Excalibur\'\' #10\\u201311</ref>\\n\\n===MI: 13===\\n{{main|Captain Britain and MI13}}\\nWhitman returned to join [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]] as part of the [[Secret Invasion]] crossover.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12843 Super Spy Weekend: Black Knight], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 10, 2008</ref> He was armed by what he believed was the Ebony Blade, which strongly encouraged him to kill, but was later revealed to be a fake<ref>\'\'Captain Britain and MI:13\'\' #7</ref> created by Dracula;<ref>\'\'Captain Britain and MI:13\'\' #9</ref> this fake possessed an intelligence and fed on blood. Dane also was revealed to have a literal stone heart, given to him by Sersi to keep him \\"above it all\\" and uninvolved.<ref name=\\"Captain Britain and MI:13 #10\\">\'\'Captain Britain and MI:13\'\' #10</ref>\\n\\nDane battled the Skrull forces in London, showing a new informal and wisecracking personality (a deliberate defence against the \\"Ebony Blade\'s\\" suggestions), and quickly bonded with medic [[Faiza Hussain]], with whom he appears to have romantic tensions. Following the Skrull war, he made her his [[squire]].<ref>\'\'Captain Britain and MI:13\'\' #5</ref>\\n\\nAfter discovering he did not have the real Ebony Blade, he went to [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] and was given the real Blade back. He still retains the fake, vampiric sword.<ref name=\\"Captain Britain and MI:13 #10\\"/>\\n\\n===Original Sin===\\nDuring the events of \'\'[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]\'\', a historian named Rebecca Stevens learned that Whitman had violently attacked and nearly killed a new version of [[Savage Steel]] due to the influence of the Ebony Blade. Rebecca pleaded with him to turn over the sword to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] or the Avengers, reasoning that its blood lust was driving him mad, but Whitman refused. Despite his assurance that he was fine, his home was seen covered in slash marks, with Whitman himself curled up on the floor in a mentally unhinged state. He is also seen threatening to slay Rebecca with the Blade but she remained unaware of the danger.<ref>\'\'Original Sins\'\' #2 (2014)</ref>\\n\\nAround this same time, Dane returned to action as the leader of Euroforce, a team of European superheroes.<ref>\'\'Avengers World\'\' #8</ref> Though he claimed to not be bitter about being excluded from Captain America\'s new team of Avengers, it was implied that Dane\'s deteriorating mental state had been the very reason he was passed over for membership.<ref>\'\'Avengers World\'\'#10 (2014)</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThe Black Knight was originally a normal athletic human being with no superhuman powers.  While sharing the \'\'gann josin\'\' with [[Sersi]], his strength, speed, and other physical abilities were mildly enhanced.  After the \'\'gann josin\'\' link was broken, Whitman returned to being a normal human being.  As part of his new role as the Pendragon, however, Whitman has gained minor mystical abilities, such as the ability to see through mystical illusions by looking \\"past the mundane.\\"\\n\\nWhitman is an excellent swordsman whose skills have allowed him to best [[Swordsman (comics)|the Swordsman]] in combat.  He is also an excellent fighter in general, able to hold his own against such skilled fighters as [[Captain America]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].  He is also an expert horseman.  Additionally, Whitman started out as a scientist, though specializing in physics (having earned a Master\'s degree in physics), he is proficient in a wide array of advanced sciences and technologies, including genetic and mechanical engineering; and continues to approach things from a scientific perspective more often than not, despite his ties to the world of magic.  He has also demonstrated good leadership skills as leader of both the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Ultraforce (comics)|Ultraforce]].  He has strong strategic and tactical skills.\\n\\n==Weapons and equipment==\\nWhitman has gone through several different sets of equipment since his creation.\\n\\n===Scientific equipment===\\nWhitman first became the Black Knight to atone for the crimes his uncle [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]] had committed using the name.  He started out with his uncle\'s non-magical tools, namely a power lance that fired energy blasts, a suit of body armor, and [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]], a genetically engineered flying white horse.\\n\\n===Ebony Blade===\\n{{Main|Ebony Blade}}\\n\\nWhitman eventually gained the Ebony Blade, a weapon that had been passed down through the ages from one of his ancestors to another.  Although it was incredibly powerful, it carried a harmful curse that caused Whitman to eventually abandon it. As of \'\'[[New Excalibur]]\'\' #10, Whitman gained possession of a faux Ebony Blade.\\n\\n===Neural Sword===\\nAfter giving up the Ebony Blade, Whitman designed and constructed a neural sword.  The neural sword resembles a [[lightsaber]] in both its appearance and its effects on non-living matter, but the sword functions differently when used against living beings.  Its \\"[[laser]]\\" blade is actually a neural disruptor; when Whitman cuts someone with the sword, it delivers a massive jolt to the being\'s central nervous system.  This jolt is usually enough to incapacitate someone within just a few hits.  Alternately, Whitman can reverse the neural sword\'s energy stream so that it encases its hilt and, by extension, Whitman\'s fist in a high-energy field.  Using the sword in this fashion enables Whitman to punch with some unspecified degree of enhanced strength.  The neural sword also creates a refraction field used to defend against energy-based attacks.\\n\\n===Avalonian equipment===\\nIn the 1997 \'\'[[Heroes for Hire]]\'\' series, the Lady of the Lake named Whitman the Pendragon for the current era and gave him an amulet.  When Whitman says the word \\"Avalon\\" while wearing the amulet, he gains the following:\\n\\n:\'\'\'Armor:\'\'\' The armor Whitman currently wears has been described as mystical.  It is said to be supernaturally durable for its light weight, but specific information on the durability of the armor is scarce.\\n\\n:\'\'\'Strider:\'\'\' Strider is a mystical creature like Valinor rather than a genetically engineered one like Aragorn, but he is unique in that he possesses mystical powers of his own.  Most notably, Strider is capable of far greater airspeeds than either of Whitman\'s previous mounts; he is easily capable of breaking the sound barrier.  Whitman can verbally summon Strider to appear at his side or return to Avalon as he pleased.  While mounted on Strider, Whitman is magically protected from any harsh environments such as the depths of the ocean.\\n\\n:\'\'\'Shield of Night:\'\'\' The Shield of Night is a mystical [[kite shield]]; it not only protects him from most attacks but also absorbs the energy of the forces directed against it.  He can then release that stored energy in the form of power blasts from his blade, the Sword of Light.  Whitman has used it to block and absorb the energy of everything from [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]]\'s explosive blasts to fire to punches.\\n\\n:\'\'\'Sword of Light:\'\'\' The Sword of Light is a mystical sword capable of projecting the energy absorbed by the Shield of Night in blasts of the same kind of energy.  It is also, supernaturally durable and can cut through almost any substance.\\n\\nWhile Whitman still has access to Strider and the mystical armor he has not been seen using the Shield of Night or Sword of Light for some time.  He has adopted a photonic shield similar to those used in the past by Captain America and U.S.Agent.\\n\\n===Miscellaneous===\\nWhitman has also employed an atomic steed, typically used by the [[High Evolutionary]]\'s [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Knights of Wundagore]], in place of a flying horse.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===Marvel Zombies===\\nWhitman appears as a zombified version of himself in [[Marvel Zombies]], in the \'\'[[Marvel Zombies: Dead Days|Dead Days]]\'\' one-shot. He can be seen battling [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in a battle between the living and dead inhabitants of the [[Marvel Universe]] in New York City.<ref>\'\'Marvel Zombies: Dead Days\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n===Ultimate Marvel===\\nIn the \'\'[[Ultimate Marvel]]\'\' reality, Dane Whitman, the second Black Knight appears in the pages of [[Ultimate Comics: Ultimates]] as a member of [[West Coast Avengers|an Ultimates team]] that preceded [[Ultimates|the current one]] by almost a decade. This version of Dane Whitman was a Corporal in the Marine Corps. After saving the lives of his fellow soldiers from an explosive in [[Baghdad]], he received the [[Purple Heart]] badge, the [[Silver Star Medal]] and the [[Medal of Honor]], but was left [[quadriplegic]]. As The Black Knight, he is highly unstable and was kept from officially joining the team until he stabilized. This never came to pass as the team made a bungle on a mission and the project was shut down immediately after until the project was revived by a corrupt California Governor who sicked them on the Ultimates.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Comics: Ultimates\'\' #23</ref>\\n\\n===Proctor===\\n[[Proctor (comics)|Proctor]] is the Earth-374 version of Dane Whitman.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/proctorgatherers.htm Proctor] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Dane Whitman makes a cameo in \'\'[[The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes]]\'\' episode \\"Come the Conqueror.\\" He is seen protecting London from an attack by Kang the Conqueror\'s forces.\\n\\n===Video games===\\n* Black Knight is a playable character in the 1995 arcade game \'\'[[Avengers in Galactic Storm]]\'\'.\\n\\n* Black Knight is a playable character in the Facebook game \'\'[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]\'\'.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Black_Knight_%28Dane_Whitman%29 Black Knight (Dane Whitman)] at Marvel.com\\n* [http://www.comics.org Grand Comics Database]\\n\\n{{Captain Britain}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by George Tuska]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by John Buscema]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Massachusetts]]\\n[[Category:Fictional knights]]\\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
