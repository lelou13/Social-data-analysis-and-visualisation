He was formally recruited after he saved the team from Sharon Ginsberg, a dangerous mutant who blamed X-Statix for the amputation of her wings. He utilizes his sentient skateboard in this incident. The team thought his youth and good looks would give them a much-needed fresh face, and [[Vivisector]] in particular was attracted to him.\n\nIt is initially difficult for Robbie to adjust to the devil-may-care, [[Hollywood]] lifestyle of his teammates. Though he tries to remain faithful to his human girlfriend, Consuela, he eventually has a tryst with two models that was secretly filmed by [[Doop (comics)|Doop]] and sold to the tabloids. Consuela leaves him and, unfortunately for Robbie, the sentient skateboard fancies her and took revenge by beating Robbie severely. Robbie, who prides himself on his good looks, could only helplessly cry, \"Not the face!\" as he was attacked.\n\nOne of El Guapo's first missions involves rescuing [[Henrietta Hunter]] from ''Euro-Trash'', a group of foreign assassins. However, El Guapo had been personally sweet-talked by the team's owner, [[Spike Freeman]] (who was temporarily imprisoned by the team), into possibly betraying the team and killing Hunter in the heat of battle. 'Blind Ali', an Iraqi mutant, gets the drop on Hunter when the battle moves into an X-Statix outlet store. After a moment's hesitation, Guapo decapitates Ali via his skateboard. Yet despite this, El Guapo goes with the team's decision to later kill Hunter themselves after she grabs the spotlight and leadership position. They do not go through with the idea.\n\nRobbie adjusts to life with X-Statix. During a mission against the [[Taliban]] he asks if this was a setup by team owner and was told it was not. Minutes later, a stray missile blows off both his legs. The rest of the opponents are slain by X-Statix, which includes Hunter. Robbie is allowed to stay on the team. His skateboard serves as a makeshift wheelchair, conveying him wherever he desires to go.\n\nRobbie survives the death of more teammates, [[Phat (comics)|Phat]] and  Henrietta Hunter, both killed by a murderous cult leader named Mister Code. Spike even dies, killed by the Orphan for being in league with Code.\n\n===Death===\n\nHunter, however, had more business even after death. She comes back to curse anyone who hums a release of a song produced after her death. The X-Statix team believes the curse is over when the head record executive dies of a massive heart attack. Later, Robbie hums part of the song while he and the team are deep in X-Statix headquarters. His flying skateboard goes out of control and Robbie smashes into a wall. The board ends up impaling him through the heart. Like the rest of Hunter's victims, his face and eyeballs are distended.\n\nHunter is put to rest when X-Statix hunts down the rest of the politicians who had caused her first death.\n\nHe is seen briefly flying on his skateboard in [[heaven]]<ref>''X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl''</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nRodriguez is a mutant who had no real powers of his own but possessed a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with his superpowered flying [[skateboard]], which was seemingly alive and had an abusive relationship with him. Rodriguez's health would also deteriorate if the skateboard was separated from him for long.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Peter Milligan]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Allred]]"}]}}}}
