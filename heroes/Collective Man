The Collective Man is actually an identity shared by the Tao-Yu brothers, a set of [[quintuplets]]. They possess the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] power to merge into one body, which variously possesses the collective abilities of all five men or of all of the people of China. The brothers also share a psychic/spiritual link that allows them to telepathically communicate and teleport to one another.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Collective Man first appeared in ''Incredible Hulk'' #250 (August 1980), and was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Sal Buscema]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Marvel Super-Heroes: Contest of Champions]]'' #1-3 (June\u2013August 1982), ''Incredible Hulk'' #279 (January 1983), ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #55 (1990), ''X-Force Annual'' #3 (1994), ''Citizen V and the V Battalion: The Everlasting'' #1-3 (April\u2013June 2001), ''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #159-160 (September\u2013October 2004), ''X-Men: The 198 Files'' #1 (January 2006), ''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #183 (April 2006), ''Civil War: X-Men'' #1 (September 2006), #4 (December 2006), ''Thunderbolts: International Incident'' (April 2008)\n\nThe Collective Man received an entry in the original ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #2, and in the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #2 (2006).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe five Tao-Yu brothers were born in [[Wuhan, China]].  The Collective Man was first seen in the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]]'s contest, in which various international superheroes fought one another the proxies of either the Grandmaster or his unknown opponent (actually [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]). The Collective Man was teamed with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Shamrock (comics)|Shamrock]] (all unknowingly proxies of Death in the conflict) in battle against the Grandmaster's proxies [[Captain America]], [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] and [[Blitzkrieg (Marvel Comics)|Blitzkrieger]]; their battle was ended when Shamrock claimed the prize.\n\nSome time after the contest, the Collective Man fought the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. At some point, the brothers' power decreased so that they only possessed the abilities of five men as the Collective Man. Later, when their superiors in the Chinese military prevented them from visiting their dying mother, Mary, the brothers rebelled and fought the god Ho-Ti, who was apparently working with the government. The brothers left the battle one by one to be at their dying mother's side. The Tao-Yu brother Ho remained to fight the god, but Ho-Ti, seeing the battle was both sad and futile, willingly departed. After the brothers discovered how China had mistreated their other mutant citizens, the Collective Man was later seen as a member of the Chinese revolutionary group 3-Peace alongside the Jade Dragon and Nuwa. They teamed with [[X-Force]] to fight the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] and the nationalistic [[China Force]].\n\nLater, the Collective Man, now restored to full power, was mystically altered by the fallen god [[Marduk]], who sought to use the Tao-Yu brothers' power to steal the life energy of every person in China in order to reclaim his divinity. The process of absorbing this life energy transformed the Collective Man into a dim-witted, raging, grotesque giant. [[Citizen V]] (John Watkins III) and his [[V-Battalion]] fought the Collective Man, with the Battalion agent [[Goldfire]] accidentally dying in the battle. Citizen V punctured the giant's skin, causing him to explode and apparently die. He survived, possibly thanks to the V Battalion's defeat of Marduk, and the brothers returned to their normal form, now gaining the ability to increase size when merged and to generate additional duplicate bodies. The Collective Man later fought the [[X-Men]] on behalf of the Chinese government when the mutant heroes attempted to free [[Xorn|Shen Xorn]] from Chinese custody. It was revealed that the brothers retained their power after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. They have since been spotted on the Xavier institute as part of the 198, where they were fighting [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and agents of O*N*E during the escape.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: X-Men]]'' #1</ref>\n\nThe Collective Man, as part of the People's Defense Force, join [[The Mighty Avengers]] and other assembled [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] teams in defeating [[The Unspoken]], an exiled [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] king seeking to enslave the Earth.<ref>Mighty Avengers #28</ref>\n\nMonths later, the Collective Man invaded [[San Francisco|San Francisco's]] organized crime circuit,<ref>Uncanny X-Men #531</ref> while its protector, Wolverine<ref>Wolverine: Manifest Destiny</ref> was incapacitated by a \"mutant flu\" bioweapon released as part of the ''X-Men: Quarantine'' storyline. He engaged and was defeated by a group of \"substitute\" X-Men consisting of Angel, Storm, Dazzler, Pixie, and Northstar.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe five Tao-Yu brothers have the mutant ability to mentally synchronize the atoms of their bodies and merge themselves into a single superhuman being. It is possible for only a few brothers to merge into this collective being, however, they prefer to merge all at once. \n\nWhile merged into their collective state, the brothers possess the sum total of their combined physical and mental capabilities. The Collective Man is capable of further increasing these traits to vast levels by mentally concentrating on the image of millions of his countrymen, a magical ability granted by the Babylonian god Marduk. However, he is only able to do so for a brief period of time. He has increased his powers to levels sufficient to physically overpower [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] in one on one combat.<ref>Marvel Super-Heroes Contest of Champions #3</ref>\n\nFollowing such a deployment of energy, the Collective Man is rendered unconscious. The length of time in which he remains unconscious depends upon the degree of exertion. If the Collective Man taps into his countrymen's physical and mental energies for too long, it can potentially prove fatal.\n\nThe brothers also possess a psi/spiritual link that lets them communicate telepathically and teleport to each other's location. In addition, they have also been shown to be decently skilled martial artists in peak human physical condition.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/collective-man UncannyXmen.net Character Profile on Collective Man]\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional Chinese people]]"}]}}}}
