Initially known as '''Captain Marvel''', the character became a leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. She later used the codenames '''Photon''' and '''Pulsar''' and is now known as '''Spectrum'''.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character was created by writer [[Roger Stern]] and artist [[John Romita, Jr.]]. She first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] Annual'' #16 (1982).\n\nTalking about the visual features of the character, Romita noted that originally the character was intended to look like [[Pam Grier]] but {{quote|...I just took some reference on Pam Grier, because I always loved her, and at the last moment somebody said that, \"Well, we need to use this woman, here,\" because they thought maybe Pam Grier wasn't as good-looking as the model they found. It was fine, because by the time she got done by other artists, it ended up looking like the generic black character, anyway.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nolen-Weathington|first= Eric |author2=George Khoury|title=Modern Masters Volume 18: John Romita Jr.|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location=[[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]]| isbn=978-1-893905-95-5 |page=126}}</ref>}}\n\nAfter her debut, the character appeared sporadically in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #227-347.

She was a lieutenant in the New Orleans harbor patrol, and operated as a cargo ship captain. Trying to prevent the creation of a dangerous weapon, Rambeau is exposed to extra-dimensional energy. As a result, she is able to convert her body to energy. She decides to use her powers to fight crime and named herself as Captain Marvel.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #16</ref>\n\n===Joining the Avengers===\nRambeau sought out the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for help in mastering her new powers and became a member-in-training of their group,<ref>''Avengers'' #227</ref> soon aiding them against [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]].<ref>''Avengers'' #229-230 (March\u2013April 1983)</ref> Befriended and mentored by Avengers veterans [[Captain America]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], Captain Marvel soon graduated to full membership after the battle against [[Plantman]].<ref>''Avengers'' #231</ref> She was the first African-American heroine of the team.\n\nShe assisted [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] in battling [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #60</ref>\n\nTwo of Rambeau's enemies were super-powered psychiatrist [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] (Karla Sofen), and Moonstone's powerful pawn [[Blackout (comics)#Blackout|Blackout]] (Marcus Daniels), who wielded the Darkforce. Captain Marvel first encounters them when the Avengers oppose the duo's escape from incarceration in [[Project Pegasus|Project: PEGASUS]]. After that, Rambeau temporarily loses her ability to transform back to human form during a battle against Dr. Eric Paulson, in which she fights alongside Spider-Man and Starfox.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #142\u2013143</ref>\n\nMoonstone and Blackout return as members of [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron (Helmut) Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil]], participating in an occupation of [[Avengers Mansion]] and trapping Rambeau in the Darkforce dimension. Rambeau was able to escape in time to help retake the Mansion. During the battle, Moonstone is crippled and Blackout dies.<ref>''Avengers'' #273-277 (Nov. 1986 - March 1987)</ref> Another of Rambeau's major early foes was the murderous interstellar pirate [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], who shanghaied Rambeau into space for an extended period before she reunites with the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #257-260 (July\u2013Oct. 1985)</ref>\n\nCaptain Marvel also took part in battles against the [[Beyonder]],<ref>,,Avengers,, #261,265-266</ref> a confused [[Jean Grey]],<ref>''Avengers'' #263</ref> [[Kang the Conqueror]],<ref>''Avengers'' #267-269</ref> [[Attuma]],<ref>''Avengers'' 272</ref> and [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #2; ''Avengers Annual'' #16</ref>\n\n===Leader of the Avengers===\nRambeau later replaces the Wasp as leader of the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers'' #279 (May 1987)</ref> commanding the attacks against the [[X-Men]],<ref>X-Men Vs.

During the battle that followed, Rambeau makes contact with sea water while in her electrical form and accidentally conducts herself across the surface of the ocean, depleting her energies so gravely and dispersing her atoms so widely that she barely regains physical form. She emerges as a frail, withered husk of a woman devoid of super-powers.<ref name=AV293>''Avengers'' #291-293 (1988)</ref>\n\n===Regaining her powers===\nAfter retiring from the team,<ref>''Avengers'' #294 (Aug. 1988)</ref> Rambeau regains first her physical health, and eventually her powers, initially developing the ability to manipulate mechanical energy for various effects.<ref name=\"CM3 1\"/> She resumes crimefighting, facing foes such as Brazilian crime lord Kristina Ramos, Moonstone, [[Powderkeg]],<ref name=\"CM3 1\"/> the [[Sons of the Serpent]],{{issue|date=September 2011}} and the Blue Marvel.{{issue|date=July 2013}} At the same time, she serves as a cargo ship captain in her friend Ron Morgan's shipping company before starting her own charter business.<ref name=\"CM3 1\"/>\n\nRambeau stays connected with the Avengers and serves as a reservist, sometimes assuming leadership duties in the absence of the current chair. She helps repel an [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] invasion of the surface world<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #18 (1989), [[Atlantis Attacks]]</ref> and assists in the [[Acts of Vengeance]], which involved a concentrated, multi-villain attack on Earth's superheroes,<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #27 (Dec. 1989), ''Avengers Annual'' #19 (1990)</ref> or in the [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus Factor]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' Vol 1 19</ref> Rambeau leads a reserve substitute roster during the team's first United Nations-backed reorganization.<ref>''Avengers'' #329 & 330 (Feb.-March 1991)</ref> She takes on another leadership role during the [[Operation: Galactic Storm|Kree-Shi'ar war]] and leads an Avengers delegation.{{issue|date=September 2011}}\n\nWhen a group of aliens calling themselves [[New Universe|Starblasters]] tries to push the moon away from Earth, [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] assembles a team with some of the most powerful heroes of the world, recruiting Rambeau, [[Carol Danvers]], [[Black Bolt]], [[Hyperion (comics)#Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Hyperion]], [[Ikaris (comics)|Ikaris]], [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]] and  [[Perun (comics)|Perun]]. During this adventure, her original powers gradually regenerated, fully returning when the alien [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] accelerates the process.<ref>''Quasar'' #55-58</ref>\n\nWhen [[Genis-Vell|Genis]] becomes an adventurer, he is known as Captain Marvel like his father before him\u2014which Rambeau resents. After she, [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]] and Genis team up to defeat the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]], Genis tries to concede the Captain Marvel title to Rambeau since he felt she was more worthy of it. Rambeau declines out of respect for the Mar-Vell legacy and adopts a new alias as Photon.<ref>''[[Avengers Unplugged]]'' #5 (June 1996)</ref>\n\n===Avengers Return===\nAfter the return of the main avengers from the [[Heroes Return|pocket universe]] created by [[Franklin Richards]] almost all the current and former Avengers members were trapped in a curse created by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] where they served her as soldiers in a guard called Queen's Vengeance.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #1-3</ref> Due to her strong loyalty to the group Rambeau, under the name Daystar, was one of the first avengers to recover their will and rebel against the sorceress.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #2</ref>\n\nLater when Photon was attacked by the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] in the [[Mardi Gras]] of New Orleans, she asked the Avengers for help being involved in an adventure in [[Arkon]]'s world with the group and her old fellow, [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #16-18</ref>\n\nFor a time, Rambeau's mother intercepts her Avengers calls out of fear for her daughter's safety.

Rambeau confronts him, but she decides to let Genis keep the Photon alias after she came up with a name she liked better: Pulsar.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #9 (August 2005)</ref>\n\nRambeau later leads the [[Nextwave]] team, part of the [[H.A.T.E.|Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort]] (H.A.T.E.), against Unusual Weapons of Mass Destruction created by the [[Beyond Corporation\u00a9]]<ref>''Nextwave'' #1 (March 2006)</ref> where she avoided using a code name and wore a new uniform.\n\nDuring the \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\", Rambeau is a member of [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers and registers as a member of the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]].<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]''</ref><ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>\n\n===The 2000s===\nIn 2009, Rambeau appeared in the limited series, ''[[Marvel Divas]]'' (partly inspired by ''[[Sex and the City]]'').<ref name=\"marveldivas\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960|title=MyCup o\u2019 Joe Tea, Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning |date=2009-04-09|publisher=MySpace Comic Books|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref> She was one of the main characters, alongside [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], and [[Firestar]]. She reveals a former relationship with [[Brother Voodoo]], from whom she broke off. Despite that, Voodoo still has feelings for Photon.

Rambeau accepts, rekindling their relationship in the process.<ref>''Marvel Divas'' #1-4</ref>\n\nRambeau later appears as one of the female heroes invited to [[Emma Frost]]'s birthday party in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].

Even the police officers that arrested the motormouth are impressed by her latest alias. Spectrum returns to a specialist shop in New York where a man named Luc sells designer superhero costumes. He mentions that someone is waiting for her in the next room. Monica recognizes the man, though apparently all he wants to do is talk and ask for help. Spectrum hears the explosions when [[Proxima Midnight]] begins her attack on the city. Her mysterious guest says he cannot be seen in America, and needs her help for a mysterious mission, but she is adamant...he is in a costume shop, and if he wants her help, he'll put on a costume and come help her.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\nMonica became field leader of Luke Cage's new [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] team in the wake of the event.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 2 #4</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDue to bombardment by extra-dimensional energies, Rambeau can transform herself into any form of energy within the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Among the many energy forms she has assumed and is able to control are [[cosmic ray]]s, [[gamma ray]]s, [[X-ray]]s, [[ultraviolet]] radiation, visible light, electricity, [[infrared]] radiation, [[microwave]]s, [[radio waves]], and [[neutrino]]s. By assuming an energy-form, she gains all of that energy's properties.\n\nShe is invisible and intangible in many of her energy forms (the most frequent exception being visible light), and is capable of flight in all her energy forms (reaching velocities up to and including light speed). She also has the ability to project these energies from her body while she is in human form (only one wavelength of energy at a time), usually in the form of energy blasts from her hands. She mentally controls both the type and quantity of energy she wishes to transmit. The maximum amount of energy she can transmit at a given time is unknown. Rambeau can also divert small amounts of various energies for employment as force beams, which have the equivalent to 300 tons of TNT of explosive force. A variation of this ability enables her to project light-based [[holograph]]ic illusions of herself. Rambeau has also shown the ability to split her energy form into several miniature energy forms that are under her mental command, each miniature Rambeau is able to react and fly at light-speed.\n\nWhen she encounters a new or unfamiliar energy, Rambeau can often duplicate it given enough time for analysis.<ref>''Avengers/JLA'' #2</ref> Rambeau tends to be physically insubstantial in her energy forms, though with concentration and effort she can sometimes perform tasks such as briefly grasping an object, either by partially solidifying or by applying some sort of force to the object in question.\n\nWhen Rambeau temporarily lost her original powers after a massive energy expenditure,<ref name=AV293/> she developed the ability to shunt any mechanical energy directed towards her through a dimensional interface surrounding her body, granting her increased strength, resistance to impact, and the ability to fly. After Rambeau asked [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] to examine these new abilities, he theorized that she accessed the same dimension from which she derived her energy powers to create the interface.<ref name=\"CM3 1\">''Captain Marvel'' vol. 3, #1 (Nov. 1989)</ref>\n\nRambeau has strong leadership skills and law enforcement experience due to both of her time as a police officer and former leader of the Avengers. She is an excellent markswoman, unarmed combatant, detective, and swimmer with extensive nautical expertise. She has received Harbor Patrol training, and Avengers training in unarmed combat by Captain America.\n\n===Limitations===\nRambeau is able to retain her energy form for several hours with no ill effects.<ref>''The Avengers'' #253</ref> She can only transform herself into one wavelength of energy at a time, but she can transform between one energy-state and another in a fraction of a second. Extensive energy transformation and manipulation can be physically taxing once she re-assumes her physical form. Rambeau can also be forcibly reverted to her original form by other forces.<ref>''The Avengers'' #263 (Jan. 1986)</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Ultron===\nDuring the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, Rambeau appears amongst the superhero resistance against Ultron.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #2-5</ref>\n\n===Earth-A===\nLike other inhabitants of this reality, Monica Rambeau would periodically visit [[Earth-616]] for vacations. Due to the nature of the interdimensional travel, she received duplicate powers to her counterpart and would masquerade as her. It is implied that the inexperienced Rambeau appearing around that time in ''Black Panther'' was, in fact, this alternate. Rambeau claimed that the main reason she visited Earth-616 was not because she would gain superpowers but because her parents were still alive in that reality.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol.4, #21</ref>\n\n===Forever Yesterday===\nMonica Rambeau is featured in ''[[New Warriors]]'' #11\u201313, in an alternate reality that is listed as Earth 9105, where she goes under the code-name of Sceptre. She is part of a murderous version of the Avengers, who enforce the will of the tyrannical female [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]].{{issue|date=September 2011}} She briefly makes an appearance in ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' #11\u201312 when she and several other alternate, evil Avengers are brought forth in order to battle the main protagonists.\n\n===''JLA/Avengers''===\nPhoton is shown as a reservist member of the Avengers and aids them during the searching of the twelve items of power, fighting against the [[Green Lantern]].<ref>Avengers/JLA #2</ref> After the battle for the last item in the [[Savage Land]], Monica takes part in one annual JLA-Avengers meeting at the [[Justice League Satellite]] in the new merged world that the villain [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] created, being unaware of the changes.<ref>Avengers/JLA #3</ref> After that she appeared fighting along with other Captain Marvels of both universes  ([[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam!]]) in the final battle.<ref>''Avengers/JLA'' #4 (May 2004)</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nMonica Rambeau appears in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' issue #3 in her [[Nextwave]] uniform, fighting alongside the rest of the team against a zombified [[Power Pack]].<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' #3</ref>\n\n===MC2===\nAlthough Monica Rambeau has never appeared in Marvel Comics' future-era [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] line, the comics feature her daughter by Derek Freeman, [[Blacklight (MC2)|Blacklight]], who first appears in ''[[A-Next]]'' #9.<ref>http://www.comicboards.com/spidergirl/view.php?rpl=000705170607</ref>\n\n===''What If?''===\nMonica Rambeau has a brief appearance in \"What if the Scarlet Witch Hadn't Acted Alone?\", ''What If?
