She was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Sal Buscema]]. Belinda Glass came up with the name and concept of the character.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk 256\">{{cite comic| writer= [[Bill Mantlo|Mantlo, Bill]]|penciller= [[Sal Buscema|Buscema, Sal]]|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= Power In the Promised Land|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 256|date= February 1981}}</ref> \"[[Sabra (person)|Sabra]]\" means both a native of [[Israel]] and a [[Opuntia|kind of prickly pear]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nRuth Bat-Seraph was born near [[Jerusalem]], Israel. She was raised on a special [[kibbutz]] run by the Israeli government after her power manifested. Ruth was the first superhuman agent created to serve the [[Mossad]] (the Israeli [[secret service]]). She became a police officer in addition to serving as a government agent. Her first public act as Sabra was a battle with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], whom she mistakenly believed was working with [[Arab]] [[terrorist]]s operating in Israel.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk 256\"/> Not long after that, Sabra was chosen as a pawn of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] in the latter's game against the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. There, she met [[Iron Man]] and the [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]], and battled [[She-Hulk]] and [[Captain Britain]].<ref>''Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions'' #1-4 (June\u2013August 1982)</ref> She later appeared at the Hulk's amnesty ceremony in Washington, D.C.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #279 (January 1983)</ref> Some years later, Sabra's young son was killed in a terrorist attack. She disobeyed orders in order to bring her son's killers to justice.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nAnother dispute with the Hulk was intensified as Sabra's powers temporarily robbed him of his voice, making it seem as if he was still a near-mindless monster. She fought the Hulk, but the two worked through their differences and attempted to search for a child who was foretold to become a genocidal maniac, while contending with [[Achilles (Pantheon)|Achilles]] of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], who was sent to kill the boy.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #386-387 (October\u2013November 1991)</ref>\n\nLater, during a peace process meeting, Sabra finds herself fighting the [[New Warriors]] while under the mental influence of a mysterious, unexplained force.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Some time after, Sabra finds herself caught up in the events of the anti-mutant campaign known as \"[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]\". It is at this time that Sabra fights alongside the [[X-Men]] and begins to subscribe to the philosophies of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Sabra spends some time as a member of the [[X-Corporation]]'s Paris branch.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} She accompanies Xavier and other X-Men to [[Genosha]] after it was demolished by [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #132 (November 2002)</ref>\n\nSabra is one of a handful of mutants to have retained their powers after the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref>''The X-Men: 198 Files'' (March 2006)</ref> She is later seen, under request from the British government, aiding [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]] against a terrorist attack on London.<ref>''Union Jack'' vol. 2, #1 (November 2006)</ref> She comes into conflict with the new [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]] because of cultural differences, but they begrudgingly work together, paralleling her relationship with the first Arabian Knight during the [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nIt is later revealed that Sabra has formed a policing force against unruly mutants. This team is fronted by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] with additional teammate [[Micromax]] (formerly of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]).<ref>''[[Civil War: X-Men]]'' #1 (September 2006)</ref> Sabra is identified as pro-registration in the superhuman [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] as one of the 142 registered superheroes under the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]].<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1 (June 2007)</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 | title=''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map | work=Marvel.com}}</ref> During the events of ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Sabra is briefly seen fighting off Skrulls in Israel.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6 (November 2008)</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Sabra is one of the heroes that respond to Spider-Man's call for help against Doctor Octopus' satellite factories. She is shown fighting through Octobots at a seemingly abandoned factory until being shot by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] with a sniper rifle.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth'' #1</ref> However, the author stated that shot was a glancing blow that Sabra has survived.{{cn|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSabra's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] power has enhanced all of her body's physical abilities, such as strength, speed, agility, reflexes, endurance, and stamina, to superhuman levels. She can withstand impacts up to high caliber rifle fire, though she has been wounded by fire from an MP-40 sub-machine gun.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nShe is also able to charge other individuals by transferring to them her own life energy, in the process enhancing their physical state of health (she has twice used this ability to save dying individuals) and granting them low-level super-powers, which are apparently at random and otherwise unrelated to Sabra's own mutant powers (such as the wind-generating powers given to a woman who took the costumed identity Windstorm). The recipient retains their new powers until Sabra herself decides to withdraw them by retrieving her life energy. Her standard power levels drop when she gives away her life energy (she has been shown losing up to half her natural physical power), but they return to normal once she takes back her life energy. She still remains susceptible to gas attacks.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nHer various costumes, usually based on the design or colors of the [[Israeli flag]], contain additional paraphernalia to enhance her combat capabilities. She wears a cape that contains a secret Israeli gravity-polarization device, which allows her to neutralize gravity's effect on her mass, and a tight array of four electric micro-turbines which impel air for sufficient thrust for inertialess mass to fly at subsonic speeds. She wears special pressure reduction valve nose-filters to allow her to breathe at high speeds and high altitudes. The cape also contains a wafer-thin computer system which processes her mental commands received by the circuitry in her tiara. The cape also has an optical navigation device which functions as an auto-pilot. Besides her cape, Sabra also has neuronic-frequency stunners built into her two wrist bracelets that shoot \"energy quills\", small bundles of low-density plasma (like balled lightning), that travel just below the speed of sound and paralyze the nervous system of any organic being almost instantaneously.\n\nIn addition to her superhuman abilities and equipment, Sabra possesses the standard weapons, and armed and unarmed combat training given to members of the [[Israeli military]]. She is trained in police methods and skills and in anti-terrorist techniques.\n\nSome accounts indicated that none of Sabra's powers are mutant in origin, but instead granted through an Israeli project similar to the American [[supersoldier]] program that created [[Captain America]], but as of the moment she is still considered a genetic mutant by the U.S. government.\n\n==Other versions==\n===House of M: Masters of Evil===\nSabra is a member of the Red Guard and assists them in their fight against the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Masters of Evil.<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #4 (January 2010)</ref>\n\n===Ultimate===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint, Sabra (under her real name) appears as a severed head on the wall of a hideout of the supervillain Doctor Faustus, along with the heads of agents from other intelligence agencies who were sent after him, but were apparently spotted and killed as well.<ref>''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]'' #2 (December 2009)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Sabra appears in the 1994 ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' animated series as the [[Silver Surfer]] passes her in the air.<ref>[http://drg4.dancemania-ex.com/fffacts.html DRG4's Fantastic Four Quickies]</ref>\n\n===Films===\n* In ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', her name was seen on a screen among a list of other mutants when [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] hacked the system of [[William Stryker]] for information on different mutants.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Marvelwiki|Sabra|Sabra}}\n\n{{Hulk}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981]]\n[[Category:Fictional Israeli people]]\n[[Category:Fictional police officers]]\n[[Category:Jewish superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]"}]}}}}
