She also appeared in ''Rampaging Hulk'' #9 (June 1978).\n\nThis version was subsequently revealed to be an alternate universe version. The mainstream [[Earth-616]] version of Bereet first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #269 (March 1982), and continued to appear in the series in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #270-282 (April 1982-April 1983), #285 (July 1983), and #287 (September 1983).\n\nBereet received an entry in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Hulk'' (2004).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBereet was a female [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#K|Krylorian]] techno-artist who used her alien technology to produce films concerning fictional adventures of herself and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Most of the population is obsessed with the escapist movie-like fantasies of techno-art films, leading to her popularity among her people.<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #1 (Jan. 1977)</ref>\nBereet later traveled to Earth and became involved with the Hulk while he had Bruce Banner's intelligence, befriending the Hulk and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]. She also encountered the criminal [[Blackbird (Femizon)|Jackdaw]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #269-282 (March 1982-1983)</ref>\n\nBereet used a number of devices such as the spatial distorter, Banshee Mask, Defendroids, her \"pet\" Sturky, and a variety of other advanced technological devices.\n\nThe planet Krylor and its population was destroyed by [[Ego the Living Planet]] during the onset of the [[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]] crossover.<ref>''Maximum Security'' #1 (2001)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a Krylorian, Bereet has a number of traits typical to their avian-mammalian semi-humanoid physique, including highly porous (\"hollow\") bones; a trilling, musical voice; two fingers and a thumb on each hand; two toes on each foot; red irises; and a deep pink skin color. She uses a number of techno-art creations including her Spatial Distorter (which she always carries over her shoulder like a [[pocketbook]]), Banshee Mask, Defendroids, Energy-Eaters, \"Flitter,\" Insula-Sphere, Life Support Spider, \"Spindrone,\" Star Eyes, and \"Web-Spider.\" Bereet demonstrated a number of other techno-art creations in her movie, but it is unrevealed if she used any or all of these in the 616 reality.\n\n==In other media==\nMelia Kreiling plays Bereet in the 2014 [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.<ref name=\"Kreiling\">{{cite web|url=http://instagram.com/p/qM1ItfIzas/|title=#gotgpicoftheday Posting this one as I land in Singapore.
