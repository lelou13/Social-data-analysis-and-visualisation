Art by Mike Allred.|thumb|left]] -->\nIn ''X-Statix'' #13, [[Peter Milligan]] had planned to use [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] in a storyline which featured her returning from the dead as a mutant superhero. News of this leaked out to the media and there followed a series of objections, most notably from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] [[newspaper]] ''[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]]''.\nQuesada and Marvel announced that they would alter the character of Princess Diana, replacing her with a fictional pop star, Henrietta Hunter (still physically resembling Diana, but with black hair and a different hairdo).<ref>{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Milligan |authorlink=Peter Milligan |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,984675,00.html |title=Princess Diana, superhero |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 25, 2003 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/henriettahunter.htm#comments|Henrietta Hunter (X-Statix leader/charity worker/pop star) }}, Retrieved September 3, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nHenrietta Hunter was a \"pop star\" from the fictional country of \"Europa\".<ref>''X-Statix,'' vol. 1 #13<!--date needed--></ref> She was the one-time leader of the X-Statix.<ref>''X-Statix,'' vol. 1 #15<!--date needed--></ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nShe was a mutant with empathic powers, the ability to read and feel the emotions of others. She could sense the pain of others. \nAfter the first time she returned from the dead, she not only regained her empathic abilities, but also increased athletic prowess and the ability to communicate with ghostly spirits. \nFollowing her second death, Henrietta once again returned in a zombie-like form. In this form, she, like other [[zombie]]s, did not appear to require food or oxygen to survive. She also appeared to be able to cause unlikely events to happen that would cause death to those who sung her song. It is unknown whether she retained any of her previous powers, as she did not display any as a corpse.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Diana, Princess of Wales}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hunter, Henrietta}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Allred]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Peter Milligan]]\n[[Category:Fictional empaths]]\n[[Category:Fictional singers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
