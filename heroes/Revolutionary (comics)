He first appeared in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' Annual #1 (January 2008), and was created by [[Dan Slott]], [[Christos Gage]] and [[Patrick Scherberger]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Revolutionary is a member of the [[Liberty Legion#Liberteens (2007)|Liberteens]], a superhero team based in [[Philadelphia]] who are the official government-approved superteam for the state of [[Pennsylvania]]. He is initially portrayed as the level-headed and respectful leader of the group; he doesn't participate in the hidden debauchery which his team commits when not in public, and shuns them for it. During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, it is revealed that he is in fact a [[Skrull]] secret agent, sent as part of a Skrull plan to conquer the Earth. It is unknown how long the Revolutionary had been replaced. The Revolutionary was shown to be in contact with  [[Criti Noll]], the Skrull posing as [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]], speaking from [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #14</ref>\n\nWhen [[Delroy Garrett|3D-Man]] began his cross country effort with the [[Skrull Kill Krew]] to rid the Initiative of Skrull infiltrators, the Revolutionary is one of the Skrulls defeated. [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] drops the diamond-skinned [[Liberty Legion#Liberteens (2007)|Hope]] on top of the Revolutionary and dramatically amplifies her mass, crushing him to a bloody pulp.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref>\n\nThe real Revolutionary appears among the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents and heroes that were replaced, attending a support group meeting.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He doesn't take part in the clash against the [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] clone called [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Skrull}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Dan Slott]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2008]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Skrull]]\n[[Category:Fictional revolutionaries]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n\n\n{{Marvel-hero-stub}}"}]}}}}
