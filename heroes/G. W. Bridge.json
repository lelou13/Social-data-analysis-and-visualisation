He is a former [[mercenary]] and high-ranking agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. He first appeared as an antagonist in \'\'[[X-Force]]\'\' (vol. 1) #1.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nLittle is known about George Washington Bridge\'s early youth. He prefers to call himself \\"G. W.\\" to avoid any jokes about the actual [[George Washington Bridge]]. A seventeen-year-old G. W. served in the [[Vietnam War]]<ref>\'\'Punisher War Journal\'\' (vol. 2) #22</ref> before later using his military skills to become a highly skilled mercenary and a part of the [[Six Pack (comics)|Wild Pack]], a group of mercenaries gathered by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Other members included Theodore Winchester ([[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]]), [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Garrison Kane]], and Eugene Eisenhower \\"Ike\\" Canty ([[Hammer (comics)|Hammer]]). In one mission, Bridge and the others experienced Cable\'s [[teleportation]] technology, a beneficial but shocking surprise. After several successful missions, the Wild Pack was hired by [[Genesis (comics)|Mr. Tolliver]], an arms dealer, under the condition that they changed their name; agents from [[Silver Sable]] had let them know that the name \\"[[Wild Pack]]\\" was taken. The team renamed itself Six Pack and went on the mission. The mission turned out to be disastrous, as they encountered [[Stryfe]], Cable\'s archenemy. Cable shot Hammer in order to prevent him from surrendering vital intelligence. Cable then left using futuristic technology that was unable to carry the other members of the team. This act convinced Six Pack that Cable purposely abandoned them. In the ensuing destruction, Kane lost both of his arms. Bridge, Domino, and Grizzly managed to escape. Kane and Hammer survived, but were heavily injured. Hammer would use a wheelchair for the rest of his life, while Kane would receive cybernetic replacements for the arms he lost.\\n\\n===Joining S.H.I.E.L.D.===\\nG. W. Bridge joined S.H.I.E.L.D. and worked his way up to [[Commander]]. When Cable joined the [[New Mutants]] and turned them into [[X-Force]], S.H.I.E.L.D. asked Bridge to investigate the team. Despite the grudge Bridge carried against Cable, he still felt that he owed Cable a warning, but it was ignored. Working with the [[Canada|Canadian]] Department K, Bridge formed [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]], a group of super-beings who all carried a grudge against Cable. Weapon P.R.I.M.E. included Garrison Kane, now known as [[Weapon X]], Grizzly, [[Rictor (comics)|Rictor]], Yeti (originally identified as [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]]), and Tygerstryke. They attacked X-Force, but found out that Cable had just left the team. Unwilling to fight his former teammates, Rictor rejoined the X-Force; and the rest of the team soon fell apart.\\n\\nWhile still recovering from the Weapon P.R.I.M.E. battle, Bridge traveled to Department K in Canada. He met with its leader, Jeremey Clarke, who would ironically turn out to be a villainous madman himself. At the time, Clarke was supervising Garrison Kane, who was training with his new arms. Bridge gave Kane vital information for a mission to bring Cable down. This mission would end with Kane making peace with Cable.\\n\\nG. W. Bridge returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. duty. He met with Cable shortly afterward and after a short fight, the two made peace. Over the next few years, Bridge would inform Cable and his allies in X-Force and the [[X-Men]] on any [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]-related problems S.H.I.E.L.D. encountered. Bridge warned Cable about [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]. Bridge unofficially hired Domino to check in on [[Danielle Moonstar]], a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who had gone undercover inside a mutant terrorist group. Her position was threatened by a Zero Tolerance operation.\\n\\nWhen Cable\'s mutant powers began to increase dramatically, Bridge started to distrust Cable again and formed a new Six Pack, this time funded by S.H.I.E.L.D., to investigate Cable. Cable defeated the Six Pack and convinced several members to take his side, but not Bridge. Shortly afterward, Cable was defeated by the [[Silver Surfer]].\\n\\nBridge and Domino reappeared when they were hired again as mercenaries. Apparently, Bridge had left S.H.I.E.L.D. at this point.<ref>\'\'Cable & Deadpool\'\' #27</ref>\\n\\n===Rejoining S.H.I.E.L.D.===\\nG. W. Bridge returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. action at the request of [[Jasper Sitwell]], looking drastically different physically. He also has converted to [[Islam]]. He is contracted to take down Frank Castle, the [[Punisher]]. However, G. W. was unsuccessful in apprehending him, despite cornering him in close quarters. In light of these events, Bridge resigned from active S.H.I.E.L.D. status because he believed that he will never have the freedom under S.H.I.E.L.D. command to use the necessary force to take Frank Castle into custody. He was immediately re-hired by Sitwell as an independent contractor, feeling this move would give him the proper freedom.<ref>\'\'Punisher War Journal\'\' (vol. 2) #1</ref>\\nRecently, Bridge has been seen recruiting Silver Sable and Domino for a task force against Castle.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\\n\\nThe recently resurrected [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]] and [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]] hold Bridge\'s family hostage to make him tell them where they can find the Punisher. Bridge is then shot in the head by a resurrected [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]] and killed. The goal was for Microchip to receive his own son back from the dead; Frank Castle would receive his family. This actually seemingly works as their coffins open and what is inside comes out. Frank has the animated bodies destroyed with fire, claiming that these were not actually the loved ones in question.<ref>\'\'Punisher\'\' #10 Vol. 7 (2010)</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nG. W. Bridge has no superhuman powers, but is trained in hand-to-hand combat, the use of firearms, and is a skilled strategist. As a high-ranking member of S.H.I.E.L.D. he has contacts all over the world and has access to advanced technology and classified information.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===MC2===\\nIn the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] continuity, G. W. Bridge has become the first [[African American]] [[President of the United States]] of that universe. He holds a close relationship to the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] as a link with A-Next, a future generation of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Television===\\n* G. W. Bridge makes a cameo in the \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]\'\' episode \\"Time Fugitive Pt. 1\\". He, [[War Machine]], and [[Nick Fury]] are shown watching a conference dealing with a virus for which mutants are supposedly responsible.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Bridge,_G.W.
