A former member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and a member of the [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]], she exists in Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]]. Firebird is a notable Latina superheroine.<ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=Y0O-Jh5dugUC&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q&f=false Multicultural Comics: From Zap to Blue Beetle], p.4</ref><ref name=AUGPLBF>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=sIMshIFtNcYC&pg=PA107#v=onepage&q&f=false A User's Guide to Postcolonial and Latino Borderland Fiction] p.107-109</ref><ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=STjcB_f7CVcC&pg=PA182#v=onepage&q&f=false Encyclopedia of Latino Popular Culture, Volume 1], p.182</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\n\nIn the story \"You Get What You Need!\" published in ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' vol.1 #265 (November 1981), writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and penciller [[Sal Buscema]] created the superhero team the [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]]. The team consists of western characters Bonita Juarez / Firebird, [[Shooting Star (comics)|Victoria Starvin / Shooting Star]], [[Texas Twister|Drew Daniels / Texas Twister]], [[Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade)|Hamilton Slade / Phantom Rider]] then called Night Rider, and [[Red Wolf#William Talltrees|William Talltrees]], the contemporary [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Green |first=Paul |date= |title=Encyclopedia of Weird Westerns: Supernatural and Science Fiction Elements in Novels, Pulps, Comics, Films, Television and Games |url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=HDnHo993Dv0C&pg=PA168#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=168 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786458004 |accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Brain/> The two women of the team had not previously appeared in comics.\n\nNot long after her first appearance, Firebird appeared several times in the ''West Coast Avengers'' title.  She has appeared in several Avengers-related storylines since then.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Origins===\nBonita Juarez was born in [[Taos, New Mexico]]. She was a devout [[Roman Catholic]], who, while walking in the deserts of [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], came into contact with a radioactive [[meteorite]] fragment. The [[radiation]] altered her [[DNA]], and gave her the power to generate flames and heat, and even fly. Believing her gifts came from God, she assumed the [[Phoenix (mythology)|mythical bird's name]], and donned a costume.<ref name=AUGPLBF/><ref name=Brain/>\n\nAs Firebird, she received a distress call from the Avengers, and mistakenly battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. She joined with other Southwestern heroes (forming a team called the [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]]), and fought the [[Corruptor (comics)|Corruptor]], rescuing [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], who had actually sent the signal.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Sal Buscema]] (plot) | cowriters = [[Bill Mantlo]] (plot, script) | penciller = [[Sal Buscema]] | inker = [[Sal Buscema]] | colorist = Bob Sharen | letterer = Diana Albers, Jean Simek | editor = [[Al Milgrom]] | story = You Get What You Need! | title = [[The Incredible Hulk]] | volume = 1 | issue = 265 | date = November 1981 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | location = [[New York, NY]]}}</ref><ref name=Brain>{{cite book |last1=Aldama |first=Frederick Luis |year=2012 |title=Your Brain on Latino Comics: From Gus Arriola to Los Bros Hernandez |url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=BaIP7O8u15UC&pg=PT41#v=onepage&q&f=false |pages=31\u201333 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292749917 |accessdate=October 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===West Coast Avengers===\nFirebird was alone when she fought against the man called [[Master Pandemonium]]. Exhausted from her battle, she fell to the ground near the new Avengers Compound on the West Coast, where she was found by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. She enlisted the aid of the [[West Coast Avengers|Avengers]] in battling against Master Pandemonium.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #4-5</ref> She assisted the Avengers during the following adventures, and desperately wanted to be invited to join, something to which chairman [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] remained oblivious, since he was trying to recruit the Thing.\n\nFirebird accompanied the Avengers to the dimension of the [[Cat People (comics)|Cat People]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #6</ref> She battled her former teammate in the Rangers, the possessed [[Shooting Star (comics)|Shooting Star]], alongside the Avengers.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #8</ref> She also battled Master Pandemonium again.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #9</ref>\n\nWhen [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] eventually found out Firebird's wish, she tried to coax her husband into inviting her, but he was consistently holding out for the Thing (who did eventually decide to become a member, but backed out before making it official). Frustrated, Firebird left on a spiritual journey.{{issue|date=October 2014}} Hawkeye would later change his mind and the Avengers sought out Firebird, but could not find her.{{issue|date=October 2014}}\n\n===La Espirita===\nEventually, she reappeared as La Espirita and arrived in the nick of time to stop [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]]'s suicide attempt. With the help of Espirita, Hank re-invented himself as the adventurer Doctor Pym, and he was able to move on from his past troubles.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #17-21</ref>\n\nWith Henry Pym and [[Moon Knight]], she rescued the Avengers who were trapped in the past.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #23</ref> She aided the Avengers in battle with [[Dominus (Marvel Comics)|Dominus]], and battled [[Sunstroke (comics)|Sunstroke]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #24</ref>\n\nThe two also shared a brief romance,{{issue|date=May 2013}} but Bonita left the team again after she helped them out on a few short adventures, to stand by Hank.{{issue|date=May 2013}} One of those adventures involved the death of both the [[Avengers (comics)|East]] and West Coast Avengers.{{issue|date=May 2013}} It was then that she found out that she was seemingly immortal, when all of the Avengers died thanks to a poison by the [[Elders of the Universe|Elder of the Universe]] [[Collector (comics)|Collector]], except her, something that the Collector found fascinating.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Firebird again===\nLater on Bonita was captured by a group of aliens from the planet Rus, who revealed that the meteorite that gave her amazing powers was allegedly waste material from a discarded alien experiment of a pupil named Yoof.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #24</ref> Nonetheless Firebird (she had returned to that name after learning this information) herself believes that her powers are a gift from [[God]]. She was called in on various Avengers meetings since then, signifying that she had somewhere accepted their membership offer. Nonetheless, Firebird largely acts as a reserve member, preferring to spend her time as a social worker.\n\nAt first Bonita was not considered as an Avenger until she attended an all-membership meeting of the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #305</ref> After that she was called in on various Avengers events. She assisted [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], [[Monica Rambeau]], [[Moondragon]], and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] in subduing the [[Awesome Android]],<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #27</ref> and encountered a small platoon of [[Homo mermanus|Atlanteans]] in Mexico getting help from a few Avengers.<ref>''Avengers West Coast Annual'' #5</ref> Firebird largely acts as a reserve member, preferring to spend her time as a social worker.\n\n===Avengers return===\nAfter the return of the main avengers from the [[Heroes Return|pocket universe]] created by [[Franklin Richards]] most of them were trapped in a curse created by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] where she served in a guard called Queen's Vengeance under the name Firemaiden<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #1-3</ref>\n\nHer immunity to radiation later made her indispensable when a mysterious energy field engulfed a small [[Russia]]n country and turned everyone into zombies during the first blows of the [[Kang Dynasty|Kang War]]. Firebird was one of the few individuals who could travel into the energy field without harm. Fellow Avenger [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] also surmised that Firebird may be immortal.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol.3) #44</ref> When Captain America is briefly transformed into an energy zombie, Thor, briefly believing him dead, begins to fear that he has become too close to his mortal comrades despite his knowledge that he would outlive them when forced to face such vivid evidence of his allies' mortality, and contemplates leaving the Avengers after the war was over. Firebird helped him to see that the bonds between him and the Avengers were so valuable precisely because they wouldn't last forever, and he shouldn't neglect them just because he would outlive them. In recognition of her advice, Thor toasted her when he arranged for Asgardian cooks to prepare a feast for the Avengers to celebrate Kang's defeat, commenting that she had taught a god a lesson by treating him as the fool he was.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol.3) #55</ref>\n\n===Beyond!===\nFirebird reappears in the limited series [[Beyond!]] along with other Marvel characters.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&old=1&id=7562 Marvel Previews: \"Uncanny X-Men,\" \"Beyond,\" \"Marvel Westerns\" & \"Incredible Hulk\"]</ref> She is depicted as having changed to a somewhat more revealing costume that bares part of her midriff. She is also shown to have a romantic attraction to Henry Pym which manifests when she kisses him after he has an argument with the Wasp.\n\n===Civil War===\nAfter a vicious battle between Captain America's Secret Avengers and [[Iron Man]]'s Pro-Registration forces during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], in which [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] was killed by a clone of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|The Mighty Thor]], Firebird, along with twenty other superheroes, joined the Secret Avengers in opposing the Superhuman Registration Act. Captain America's dialogue implies that the new members, including Firebird,<ref>''Civil War'' #4</ref> are registered heroes who have nonetheless turned against Iron Man's forces because of the Bill Foster debacle. Weeks after the conclusion to the Civil War; Firebird is seen as one of the members of the revived [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]], as part of the [[50 States Initiative]] Program.<ref>''Civil War'' #7</ref>\n\nBonita has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book [[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>\n\nIn ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2 she is seen attacking [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] along with the Rangers.\n\n=== Secret Invasion ===\nDuring the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Firebird was with the Rangers when they, [[Delroy Garrett|Delroy Garrett / 3-D Man]], and [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Eric O'Grady / Ant-Man]] were fighting a [[Skrull]] that was posing as Lobo, Red Wolf's [[wolf]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Dan Slott]] | cowriters = [[Christos N.

As Firebird, she has the power of [[pyrokinesis]], which enables her to mentally excite the atoms in an object until it spontaneously combusts. By using her powers to ignite the air around her, she can surround herself with an aura of flames that often takes the shape of a bird, and if she focuses her flames downwards in a tight stream, she can propel herself through the air like a rocket. She can channel her powers through her hands to seemingly project searing thermal blasts from her body (actually from her mind), capable of melting steel. She can fly by riding wind currents stirred up by the nimbus of fire with which she surrounds herself while flying. Although she can propel herself at superhuman speeds, she cannot breathe at those speeds without skin protection and an oxygen supply. Fatigue impairs her performance after approximately one hour of peak expenditure of power.\n\nShe has also displayed a limited power of [[precognition]], allowing her to have glimpses of the future.\n\nFirebird also seems to be immune to most forms of radiation and poison (and even demonic possession) as well as the physical effects of her mental powers, and has displayed the ability to survive in the vacuum of space. Firebird may be immortal, but the precise details of this are unclear beyond the fact that she has twice survived apparently fatal attacks that only Thor - himself an immortal - could withstand.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===MC2===\nIn the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, Firebird was killed in the final mission of the original Avengers.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco]]| penciller = [[Ron Frenz]] | inker = Al Milgrom | colorist = Bob Sharen | letterer = Jim Novak | editor = Bob Harras | story = After the Fall! | title = [[A-Next]] | issue = 7 | date = April 1999 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | location = [[New York, NY]]}}</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn the [[Marvel Zombies]] universe, Firebird is one of the heroes changed into a [[zombie]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Victor Gischler]] | penciller = Bong Ty Dazo | inker = Leonardo Ito | colorist = Matt Milla | letterer = Jeff Eckleberry | editor = [[Axel Alonso]], Sebastian Girner | title = [[Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth]] | issue = 11 | date = July 2010 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | location = [[New York, NY]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=5256 |title=Preview: Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth #11 |date=May 20, 2010 |website=comicbookresources.com |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=October 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Firebird|Firebird}}\n* {{Comicbookdb|character|4855|Firebird}}\n* {{Comicbookdb|character|26597|La Espirita}}\n* [http://web.archive.org/web/20061105104301/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/2855/firebird.html The Women of Marvel Comics Firebird Page]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with fire or heat abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with precognition]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Mexican descent]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]"}]}}}}
