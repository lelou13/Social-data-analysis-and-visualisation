Though not related to [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], her powers and costume certainly invoke him, in the same way many of the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe characters resemble those of [[Earth-616]].\n\nLittle is known about the energetic Bluestreak's past. It is known that she is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] gifted with incredible speed, who left the newest incarnation of the [[X-Men]] (the [[X-People]]) because they were not \"flashy\" enough for her. Bluestreak's real name is later revealed as Blue Kelso.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' (2006) #2.</ref>\n\nBluestreak joins the '''Dream Team''', who soon become part of the new [[Avengers (comics)#Avengers Next|Avengers]] team. She quickly develops a crush on teammate [[J2 (comics)|J2]] (a fact to which he is completely oblivious). Cocky and impulsive, Bluestreak often has problems following the orders of [[Mainframe (comics)|Mainframe]]. The only thing that surpasses her exuberant attitude is her skill at using her speed. When Mainframe's inert body needs to be taken across the city in less than a minute, she places him on a gurney and covers the needed distance in virtually no time at all, even remarking afterwards that she could have stopped for a sandwich, but did not want to show off.\n\nBluestreak is not to be confused with the deceased similarly named, techno-based villain Blue Streak.\n\nBluestreak is a mutant capable of running at superhuman speeds. Her top velocity is unknown, but she can exceed the speed of sound. She also possesses incredible stamina and can run for long periods of time without showing any signs of fatigue.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/bluestreakscourge.htm|Blue Streak (Don Thomas)}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/bluestreakrr.htm|Blue Streak (Jonathan Swift)}}\n* [http://www.marvel.wikia.com/Don_Thomas_%28Earth-616%29 Blue Streak (Don Thomas)] at Marvel Appendix\n\n{{S.H.I.E.L.D.}}\n{{MC2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blue Streak (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by John Buscema]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics 2]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D. agents]]"}]}}}}
